<p class="dropcap-t"><span class="smcap letter-spaced">This</span> little book is written under a deep sense of
obligation to the womanhood of the world,
but more especially under a sense of duty to
God. A group of women of the British
aristocracy have lifted their voices in advocacy
of licensed vice; and their sycophants and admirers
in England and America are either re-echoing their
plea or excusing their conduct. The plea is made
primarily for India, but incidentally for all Christendom,
and every effort is being put forth, openly or covertly,
to contaminate public sentiment on this point.</p>

<p>In five States of America, in a little over a year, the
attempt has been made to secure legislation for the
compulsory periodical examination of women; and a
strong organization exists on both sides of the water to
promote this infamous object. Under these conditions
it is a matter of grave moment that certain secular,
temperance, and religious periodicals which would have
sounded a clear note of warning six months ago, are today
being deceived. They print the outrageous falsehoods
that represent India as having become a menace
to the health of England because of the abolition of
brothel slavery in that country. Excuses are made for
the shallow-brained sophistry of those who pretend that
the compulsory periodical examination of women can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
be divorced from the moral debasement of women, and
as though such compulsory examination were something
quite unlike the notorious Contagious Diseases Acts.
High titles and famous names are quoted as a warrant
for advocating the iniquity; and certain men are being
exalted as though famous temperance advocates, who
are not themselves total abstainers, and who are well-known
public advocates of licensed fornication. Thus is
introduced into philanthropic movements of the present
day an element of fatal moral confusion, as though a
person who boldly defies the principles of ordinary
decency in one direction could be received as a trusted
and efficient promoter of decency along another line; as
though a man could be relied upon as an advocate and
apostle of that of which he is not an example. We do
not doubt that some of the persons who do these things
are well-intentioned; but they expend their benevolence
on the wolf and forget the lamb. They would win
others to play with them on the asp’s nest.</p>

<p>We have determined on our knees before God that
those who advocate the compulsory periodical examination
of women shall do so knowing what it means, and
knowing also that their friends and neighbours understand
what is being advocated.</p>

<p>We offer no apology for our plainness of speech; to
employ smooth language and obscure phrases in the
present crisis would be to trifle with a deadly enemy—to
toy with the Indian cobra.</p>

<p>I wish that every woman in the United Kingdom
could read this little book. It tells the truth, the terrible
truth, concerning the treatment of certain Indian women,
our fellow-citizens and sisters, by the British Government.
I believe if that truth were known throughout the
length and breadth of our land, it would become impossible
for our rulers to continue to maintain the
cruel and wicked Regulations by which these Indian
women are enslaved and destroyed.</p>

<p>I am a loyal Englishwoman; I love my country. It
is because of my great love for her that I mourn so
deeply over her dishonour in the promotion of such
legislation and practices as this book exposes, and that
I will not cease to denounce the crimes committed in
her name so long as I have life and breath.</p>

<p>I thank God that the writers of this book have been
raised up to plead the sacred cause of Justice and of
Womanhood; and I rejoice to know that God has
bestowed on them a measure of the fearless spirit of the
faithful prophets and prophetesses of old, to rebuke
national sin and to preach repentance to the people.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">Dear Friends</span>,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad you intend to reprint “The Queen’s
Daughters in India.”</p>

<p>It brings home to many who will never read Blue
Books the terrible facts about officially-authorized vice;
and it shows the moral aspects of the “Regulation”
system, which Blue Books never show.</p>

<p>I remember very clearly how your first Report, in
1892, of what you had seen, impressed us all as a very
careful record of a very careful investigation.</p>

<p>Then, in 1893, I was a member of the Departmental
Committee appointed to hear your evidence, when your
clear testimony, which no cross-examination could
shake, gave abundant evidence of your close observation
and the accuracy of your records.</p>

<p>The impression this made on me was only deepened
when, in India, in 1894 (on the Opium Commission), I
saw one of the places you had described with such
remarkable closeness of detail.</p>

<p>It is deplorable that we should have to fight this
battle again. But so it is. Princesses and Titled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
Ladies have added their influence to that of the panic-mongering
materialists, in the endeavour to “make the
practice of prostitution, if not absolutely innocuous, at
least, much less dangerous”—for that is, in the language
of the Royal Commissioners of 1871, the object in
view.</p>

<p>I thank God, therefore, that you are able to visit this
country again, to help us both by voice and pen in the
renewed agitation which is forced upon us.</p>

</div>
<p class="dropcap-a">A <span class="smcap">gentleman</span> in India, who had spent many
years in military service, told us the following
<span class="no-break">tradition:—</span></p>

<p>“In the year 1856, before the Mutiny,
Lady —— was one evening riding out on
horseback at Umballa, unattended, when the bridle of
her horse was suddenly seized by a British soldier who
was possessed of evil designs against her. Most earnestly
she protested against his violence, and remonstrated
with him that, besides the wrong to her, to injure one
of her social rank would utterly ruin his entire future, as
he would be flogged and dismissed from the army in
disgrace. Thereupon ensued a conversation in which
he pleaded extenuation for such a crime so successfully
that she readily accepted his false statement that there
was excuse for vice when soldiers were not allowed to
marry. After that experience she sought opportunity
to talk with high military officials concerning the
necessity of protecting high-born ladies from such risks,
by furnishing opportunities for sensual indulgence to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
British soldiers, and the result was the elaboration and
extension of a system for the apportionment of native
women to regiments.” We have never been able to
verify the exact truth of this incident, but it probably
has a basis in fact. Yet it has had its counterpart in a
recent movement among the aristocratic women of
England to re-introduce the same wicked legislation.
It is on this account that the authors have considered it
necessary to print a more extended account of the work
in behalf of the women of India, in which they have had
a large share. If the exceedingly simple style in which
they give their story seems to some readers almost an
insult to their intelligence, and lacking in the delicacy of
touch that could be desired, it must not be forgotten for
one moment that they are writing with special regard
for those in the humblest ranks of life, who have often
had scant opportunities for education; for it is upon the
daughters of such that the oppressive laws for the
licensing of prostitution fall; and in large part the
supposed advantages of licensed prostitution accrue to
the upper social classes, which are, in fact, the lower
moral classes. The crusade against licensed fornication
is a war between respectable daughters of the poor and
rich and powerful men and women.</p>

<p>Whether the narrative given above be wholly true
or not, the fact remains that when so-called “Christian
England” took control of “heathen India,” and plots
of ground called Cantonments were staked off for the
residence of the British soldiers and their officers, full
provision was made for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts
thereof. A Cantonment is a considerable section of
land, sometimes comprising several square miles; and
within these Cantonments much more arbitrary law
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
prevails than the civil law by which the rest of the
country is governed. There are about one hundred
military Cantonments in India. Sometimes these Cantonments
have few inhabitants besides the soldiers and
a few traders in groceries, etc., for the soldiers; and
again in some places a whole city has grown up within
the Cantonment, and many Europeans reside therein,
feeling more safe in case of threatened trouble from
an uprising of the people against the Government, than
outside under civil law only. All the land of a Cantonment
belongs to the Government, and in case of
war the military officials may seize, for residence, all
the houses within the Cantonment without regard to
the actual owners of the buildings, and the commanding
officer has the power of expelling any one
he pleases from the Cantonment, without assigning any
reason for so doing.</p>

<p>The system devised for furnishing sensual indulgence
to the British soldier, and for protecting him from
diseases consequent on such indulgence, was commonly
called the Contagious Diseases Acts, but was carried
out under Cantonment Regulations, and was as follows
in its main <span class="no-break">features:—</span></p>

<p>There were placed with each regiment (of about a
thousand soldiers) from twelve to fifteen native women,
who dwelt in appointed houses or tents, as the case
might be, called “chaklas.” These women were allowed
to consort with British soldiers only, and were registered
by the Cantonment magistrate, and tickets of license
were given them.</p>

<p>Besides the “chakla,” <i>i.e.</i>, the Government brothel,
there was in each Cantonment a prison hospital, in which
the patients were confined against their will. To these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Lock Hospitals the women were obliged to go periodically
(generally once a week) for an indecent examination,
to see whether every part of the body was free
from any trace of diseases likely to spread from them to
the soldiers, as the result of immoral relations. The compulsory
examination is in itself a surgical rape. When a
woman was found diseased, she was detained in the hospital
until cured; when found healthy she was given a
ticket of license to practise fornication and was returned
to the chakla for that purpose.</p>

<p>In case a woman tried to escape from the chakla, or
from the Lock Hospital, and was apprehended, she
would be taken to the Cantonment magistrate, who
would punish her with fine or imprisonment.</p>

<p>Even the price of the visits of soldiers to the chakla
was fixed by military usage, and was so low that the
soldier would scarcely miss what he expended in vicious
indulgence. We have frequently heard in England that
the officers sent out in the English towns to secure
recruits for the army hold out, as an inducement to
young men to enlist, the fact that a licentious life in
India is so cheap, and that the Government will see to
it that no disease will follow the soldiers’ profligacy.
But this last promise is altogether false, for statistics
show that with all their efforts diseases increase with
the increase of licentiousness, with small regard to the
military surgeons’ efforts to make it physically safe.</p>

<p>When a regiment came into a large Cantonment
where there were barracks, there was generally a large
Government brothel to which all the women were sent
for residence, and a guard in uniform looked after
them. When the soldiers were camped out in the
open field, tents were set up for the women at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
back part of the encampment. When the soldiers
marched, the women were carried in carts, with British
soldiers to guard them, or sent by train to the destination
of the regiment. In charge of the women was placed a
superintendent or brothel-keeper, called the “mahaldarni.”
She also was expected to procure women as
desired; and we have ourselves read the official permits
granted these women to go out to procure more women
when needed.</p>

<p>On June 17, 1886, a military order, known among the
opponents of State regulation as the “Infamous Circular
Memorandum,” was sent to all the Cantonments of
India by Quartermaster-General Chapman, in the name
of the Commander-in-Chief of the army in India (Lord
Roberts). But during the course of the enquiry of the
Departmental Committee of 1893, its real author was
discovered to be Lord Roberts himself, not his Quartermaster-General.</p>

<p>This Memorandum (Parliamentary Paper No. 197, of
1888) is a lengthy document, every part of which has
painful interest; but we can only give a faint outline. It
specified certain measures to be instituted as means for
looking more carefully after the health of British soldiers,
and the observations therein were to be heeded by the
“military and medical authorities in every command”
throughout India. (See <a class="deco-none" href="#Appendix_A">Appendix A</a>.)</p>

<p>This order said (and military orders are well-nigh
inexorable): “In the regimental bazaars<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> it is necessary
to have a sufficient number of women, to take care that
they are sufficiently attractive, to provide them with
proper houses, and, above all, to insist upon means of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>ablution being always available.” It proceeds: “If
young soldiers are carefully advised in regard to the
advantage of ablution, and recognise that convenient
arrangements exist in the regimental bazaar [that is, in
the chakla], they may be expected to avoid the risks
involved in association with women who are not recognised
[that is, licensed] by the regimental authorities.”
In other words, young soldiers are not expected to be
moral, but only to be instructed as to the safest way of
practising immorality. This remarkable document goes
on to suggest that young soldiers should be taught to
consider it a “point of honour” to save each other from
contagion by pointing out to their officers women with
whom there was risk of disease. The document calls
attention to the need of more women, and the necessity
of making the free quarters “houses that will meet the
wishes of the women”—in order, it is implied, that they
may be the more easily lured to live in them.</p>

<p>The official record of what followed, as a result of
effort on the part of under-officials to carry out the
instructions of the Commander-in-Chief (Lord Roberts)
is truly shocking, as might be expected. The officer in
command of the 2nd Battalion Cheshire Regiment
sent the following application to the magistrate of
Umballa Cantonment: “Requisition for extra attractive
women for regimental bazaar, in accordance with
Circular Memorandum 21a.” “These women’s fares,”
it continues, “by one-horse conveyances, from Umballa
to Solon, will be paid by the Cheshire Regiment on
arrival. Please send young and attractive women, as
laid down in Quartermaster-General’s Circular, No.
21a.” Then he added a note to the effect that some of
the women already at hand were not very attractive,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
adding: “Application has been made to the Cantonment
magistrate of Umballa for others, but up to date
none have arrived; therefore, it is presumed a great
difficulty exists in procuring the class of young women
asked for.” Evidently it was an amazing thing to these
self-styled Christian military officials that heathen
women would not flock to their slave pens!</p>

<p>Another commanding officer writes: “There are not
enough women; they are not attractive enough. More
and younger women are required, and their houses
should be improved.” Yet another commanding officer
writes: “I have ordered the number of prostitutes to
be increased to twelve, and have given special instructions
as to the four additional women being young and
of attractive appearance.”</p>

<p>Such was the zeal for increasing the facilities for safe
vice, provoked by such military methods as described
by this Memorandum, that the unwillingness of the
native women to plunge into a life of shame at the
behest of their conquerors, received scant consideration.
A retired soldier, living at Lucknow, told us of his
own observations a few years before: that, if a native
policeman saw a young girl talking indiscreetly, though
innocently, with a man, he would denounce her as a
suspected prostitute; she would be brought before the
Cantonment magistrate, and be registered to live among
the soldiers. He said the police made large sums of
money by threatening to thus hand over girls to the
magistrate, and demanding bribes as the alternative of
such a horrible fate. A Christian Englishman, holding
a responsible position under the Government, vouched
for by the Editor of the <i>Bombay Guardian</i>, relates what
he saw in four Cantonments, where the instructions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the “Infamous Memorandum” were carried out, in the
following <span class="no-break">language:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The orders specified were faithfully carried out, under the
supervision of commanding officers, and were to this effect. The
commanding officer gave orders to his quartermaster to arrange
with the regimental <i>Kutwal</i> [an under-official, native] to take two
policemen (without uniform), and go into the villages and take
from the homes of these poor people their daughters from fourteen
years and upwards, about twelve or fifteen girls at a time. They
were to select the best-looking. Next morning, these were all put
in front of the Colonel and Quartermaster. The former made his
selection of the number required. They were then presented with
a pass or license, and then made over to the old woman in charge
of this house of vice under the Government. The women already
there, who were examined by the doctor, and found diseased, had
their passes taken away from them, and were then removed by the
police out of the Cantonment, and these fresh, innocent girls put
in their places.”</p></blockquote>

<p>There is a whole volume of misery expressed in that
last sentence, both for the fresh, innocent girls, and for
the diseased ones turned out of the Cantonment. It
has been repeatedly asserted that this system of regulating
vice was so merciful, even to the girls; for their
diseases, it has been claimed, were never allowed to go
beyond the initial stage. But what this witness states
is strictly in accordance with what we found to be the
case. When we visited some of these Lock Hospitals
and examined the records kept there, we noted that in
the annual reports no cases of secondary stages of disease
were mentioned; but when we questioned the native
physicians in charge as to whether these ever arose, they
answered that frequently such cases occurred, but when
a woman became unfit to practise prostitution, because
of that fact, she was turned out of the Cantonment.</p>

<p>The British officials of India have not shown the
slightest concern as to the spread of disease, even when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
introduced by their own race among the natives, but have
actually sent these women abroad to scatter disease wherever
they go. And what can a poor Army slave-woman
do when thus turned out? Her caste is broken, because
she has lived with foreigners, and her friends will seldom
receive her back; she has been compelled to follow the
soldiers on the march; and when dismissed may be
hundreds of miles away from any human being who ever
saw her face before. Practically almost every industrial
door in India is closed to women, the nurse-girl to foreign
children being so exceptional as not worthy of mention
among the hundreds of millions of people. The Cantonment
sometimes includes all there is of city life in the
whole region, and the woman has no choice but the open
fields or the jungle. God alone knows the fate of these
helpless creatures, and few beside care to know.</p>

<p>This was the exact state of things, with details too
infamous to commit to paper, until 1886, when the
Contagious Diseases Acts which had prevailed in the
military stations of England were repealed as the result
of a remarkable crusade led by Mrs. Josephine Butler.
As the dependencies of Great Britain are all supposed
to be governed by the same policy as that of England
the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts there virtually
repealed them in India. But it was not until
1888 that a despatch was sent to India by the Secretary
of State for India, whose duty it is to attend to such
matters, declaring that the system was “indefensible,
and must be condemned.”</p>

<p>A copy of Lord Roberts’ “Infamous Memorandum”
fell into the hands of a Christian gentleman who sent
it to England. It was there reprinted and distributed
to every member of the House of Commons, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
created a great sensation, meeting with almost universal
condemnation. Following upon the popular indignation
created thereby, the House of Commons on June
5, 1888, passed a unanimous resolution that “Any mere
suspension of measures for the compulsory examination
of women, and for licensing and regulating prostitution
in India, is insufficient; and the legislation which enjoins,
authorizes, or permits such measures ought to be
repealed.”</p>

<p>The publication of the “Infamous Memorandum” in
England had shown that the existing Indian Cantonment
Acts must be condemned, and they were
superseded by rules made under a new law, the
“Cantonments Act of 1889.” This was a very specious
document, which avoided the issue by merely placing
unlimited powers in the hands of the Governor-General
in Council to “make rules consistent with this Act, for
the prevention of the spread of infectious and contagious
disorders within the Cantonment.”</p>

<p>It was so recognised and pronounced upon by the
newspapers of India, which favoured licensed vice.
Commenting on the new Cantonments Act one newspaper
said: “The religious fanatics who howled until a
weak Government gave way to their clamour …
will probably howl again now at the way the old order
of things will be enforced under another name, but with
very little difference in manner.” Another said: “Their
phraseology is the work of a master in the art of making
a thing look as unlike itself as it well can be.” Many
others spoke in the same strain. Immediately the
advocates of the abolition of licensed prostitution took
alarm, and began a vigorous remonstrance; for
they saw great danger in any law which put large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
discretionary power into the hands of officials. The
late Rt. Hon. Sir James Stansfeld, M.P., and Professor
Stuart, M.P., addressed a letter to the Secretary of State
for India concerning this new Act, in which they said,
among other things: “If our interpretation of the new
proposed regulations is correct, they may be used to set
up again a system of compulsory examination of prostitutes,
and to regulate and license, within the Cantonment,
the calling of those prostitutes who submit to
periodical examination, and to certify and license those
who are pronounced physically fit.”</p>

<p>The official reply from the Secretary of State for
India was to the effect that the Home Government was
unwilling to believe, without positive proof, that this new
Cantonments Act would be used to foster licensed
prostitution.</p>

<p>It should be explained here that Abolitionists have
always recognised that to establish the periodical examination
is, in and of itself, to license prostitution; for
there can be no possible excuse for the reiterated examination
of healthy women, in anticipation of possible
contagion, without recognising a certain right to practise
prostitution, if the women be pronounced medically
“fit” for such a calling. The periodical examination of
women, then, constitutes the living heart of all those
forms of legislation generally comprised under the term,
“The Contagious Diseases Acts,” by whatever local
name such regulations may be known.</p>

<p>We came to England in the winter of 1890–91,
it being the first country visited by us on a round-the-world
journey for the World’s W.C.T.U., with
which we were, at that time, officially connected.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>During this visit we frequently met and talked with
Mrs. Josephine Butler, known and revered by lovers of
purity throughout the world for her heroic service
in the cause of the Abolition of State Regulation of
Vice. She expressed a strong desire that while in India
in the course of our journey we should make a careful
investigation into the conditions prevailing there, and
learn, if possible, whether the resolution of the House
of Commons of June 5, 1888, was being obeyed. As
already noted, this resolution demanded the repeal of
all measures that enjoined, authorized, or permitted the
compulsory examination of women and the licensing
and regulation of prostitution. It was desired also that
we should secure for the use of Parliamentary members
of the British Committee of the Federation for the
Abolition of State Regulation of Vice actual proof that
the resolution was being disobeyed, such as would meet
the official demand for proof from the Secretary of
State, before he would be willing to believe that the
new Cantonments Act was being used to foster licensed
prostitution. The mission was pronounced by Mrs. Butler
“one of the most difficult and even perilous missions ever
undertaken in the course of our great crusade.” After
due consideration and prayer for guidance, we consented
to undertake the task.</p>

<p>The British Committee of the Federation furnished
us with all necessary official documents with which to
make ourselves thoroughly conversant with the history
of the C.&nbsp;D. Acts throughout the British dependencies
in the Orient, and supplied us with a letter of introduction
to a staunch friend of the cause in India,
with whom we were expected to hold frequent consultations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>We took our departure from England in the month
of July, 1891, going first of all to South Africa and
labouring in the interests of our work there until the
cold season set in and we could proceed to India.
Reaching India at the end of December, 1891, we conveyed
our letter of introduction to this confidential
friend, who advised us to proceed northward and consult
with a friend of the cause who understood thoroughly
the interior life of the people, and, it was believed,
would give great aid to our mission. Travelling northward
we arrived at the station designated, and sought
an interview with this gentleman.</p>

<p>We intimated to him what we hoped to accomplish
in India, with a view to obtaining an expression from
him of his willingness to aid us. With consternation
and embarrassment he protested against our undertaking
anything so foolish and impracticable, declaring
from his long experience that it was utterly impossible
for women to get at the truth, and entreating us to
abandon so wild a project. When he saw that we did
not yield the matter, he questioned us as to what we
were planning to do, how we should proceed to get
information in a country whose customs and language
were so utterly unknown to us, and concerning a military
system with which, as Americans, we were quite
unacquainted. We withheld further confidence, simply
saying with earnestness, “Whether this is practicable or
impracticable, women have a right to this knowledge;
and we do not think it foolish or impracticable to trust
God to give us all the information we need, without
human aid.”</p>

<p>He felt the most kindly interest in us personally, and
manifested this by several practical expressions; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
doubtless he reasoned that he could not encourage us in
what he believed to be an impossible undertaking.</p>

<p>This experience drove us to God, our only helper.
We were strangers in a strange land, carrying the burden
of a sacred secret which weighed us to the earth. After
much prayer and deliberation we called on the chief
military surgeon in charge of the station hospital of ——
Cantonment. This official began almost immediately
when we called upon him, and entirely without suggestion
from us, to deplore “the repeal of the C.&nbsp;D. Acts,”
and, as he claimed, the consequent increase of specific
diseases. He showed us his daily report, which
illustrated what he said on this subject. These diseases,
he said, were for the most part contracted on the march
or in the hills, especially at Ranikhet. This interview
took place on January 4, 1892.</p>

<p>The surgeon said he wondered that people did not,
from the moral and religious point of view, see the injury
that the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts was
doing, not only to the soldiers but to the whole country;
“and,” he added, “we can do nothing.” We asked, “Is
there, then, no form of regulation now?” He answered
emphatically, “<i>None whatever.</i>” He said, “We can do
nothing about the women outside the Cantonment, and
there is the trouble.” He added, “Those inside go on
as they used to, and go to the hospital for treatment
when diseased. But,” he continued in an aggrieved
tone, “this is absolutely voluntary; we have no
control.”</p>

<p>He said there was a European physician in charge of
the hospital, to whom he had just been talking regarding
the matter when we came in. We said, “There is a
European physician in charge, then, is there?” He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
answered, “Yes; but the hospital is not for these diseases
only, but also for fevers, dysentery, cholera, and all
diseases”; and that there were men there as well as
women. We asked, “Is the Lock Hospital, then, entirely
disused?” He replied, “Why, there is <i>no</i> Lock Hospital.”
He added that many good people were getting their eyes
opened now as to the condition of things, and that even
some clergymen had the courage of their moral convictions,
and had come out in favour of the Contagious
Diseases Acts.</p>

<p>Previous to leaving England we had received information
concerning this Cantonment and its Lock Hospital.
Our information, compared with this official’s inconsistent
statements, convinced us that he was endeavouring to
mislead us. After other and many futile efforts to
reach the truth, we gave ourselves up wholly to prayer,
remembering the promise, “They shall come with weeping,
and with supplications will I lead them. I will
cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight
way, wherein they shall not stumble.” We felt sure that
any mistake at the outset of our work, such as giving
confidence to the wrong person, or any indiscreet action
that might betray our object in visiting India, would be
fatal to our purpose; therefore we cried to God to preserve
us from impatience and to keep our feet from
stumbling.</p>

<p>We went next to Agra and remained there several
days, wandering about the old fort and other places of
interest. But surely never was sadder sight-seeing!
The way seemed utterly closed against us. The work
stretched, vast and difficult, before us, and those towering
thick walls that surround the fort, with a deep moat
at their foot, represented to our thoughts the pride,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
strength, and secrecy of the system which we sought to
penetrate, and at other times the barriers that separated
us from the enslaved women whom we had come to
India in the hope of helping.</p>

<p>Nearly five weeks had gone by; the winter season
was rapidly passing, and we were yet without a single
clue to guide us in our investigations.</p>

<p>One Sunday we set apart for fasting and prayer—in
the morning instructing the native servants at the Rest
House where we were staying to leave us uninterrupted
until the evening, as it was a sacred day with us, and we
wished to be alone. We locked our doors and waited
on the Father of spirits for guidance. Never shall we
forget the hours of that day. At the beginning our
hearts seemed completely crushed under a sense of our
absolute helplessness and ignorance; but we know now
that we were in the very place of power—that it was
only there that God could reveal Himself to our waiting
spirits. It was at the first, however, inexpressibly dark.
Still we held on, in faith that light would come; and
before night, light was fully given to us both, as to our
next step, which was that we were to go to a friend in a
neighbouring city and lay the whole case before her.
We obeyed the guidance; and although our friend was
exceedingly hopeless as to our undertaking, yet she was
willing to give us the assistance of her quick intelligence
and long acquaintance with India. She proved of
invaluable service to us in teaching us many simple
colloquial phrases, and inducting us into a knowledge of
the customs of the country, thus making us much more
independent in our work and travels.</p>

<p>At this time it became clear to us that we must
approach the whole question from the native side. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
had gained nothing in seeking information from European
officials. Our hope now lay in interviewing the
native physicians and the women themselves. We did
not at first venture to ask the way to the Lock Hospital,
taking it for granted that this term had long before
fallen into disuse, as the existence of this hospital was
officially denied. But after visiting various hospitals
within a Cantonment, and failing to find the “Cantonment
Hospital” so called, which term we were told was
now applied to the place for which we were searching,
we asked for the Lock Hospital, and to our surprise
found that in common parlance it was still so named.
Our cab-drivers always understood instantly what we
meant when we used either this term or the native term,
which means a hospital for degraded women. Our first
actual interview was held with the dhai, or nurse, and
inmates of a Lock Hospital. Besides much valuable
information gained from them, we learned the native
name used to designate the quarters within the military
Cantonments for degraded women, viz., “The Chakla.”</p>

<p>From this time forward, our way became much more
plain, as in the ten Cantonments visited<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> we found that
we needed only to give directions to our cabmen and
they would take us without hesitation both to the Lock
Hospital and to the chakla, these places being perfectly
well known to the natives residing within the Cantonment.</p>

<p>These Cantonments are all under military rule. As
our work lay only within the Cantonments the military
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>regulations, of course, applied to us. One of these
rules made it possible at any time for us to be excluded,
for it refers to “persons whom the Commanding Officer
deems it expedient to exclude from the Cantonment,
with or without assigning any reason for excluding
them therefrom” (Cantonments Act, chap. 5, sec. 26,
clause 23). It was necessary, therefore, that we should
not attract attention to the fact that we were making
investigations as to whether the resolution of the
House of Commons was being obeyed or not by the
military authorities. Had our errand been suspected,
we could have been sent out of the Cantonment at once,
with no explanation and no opportunity for redress.
We therefore proceeded as quietly as possible.</p>

<p>Towards the last our enquiries proceeded very
rapidly, for we had learned to accomplish as much in
one day as would formerly have occupied a week. The
winter season was over, and we were now in the month
of March, with the heat of the advancing Indian summer
daily increasing in terrible force, and becoming
oppressive to our unaccustomed Anglo-Saxon constitutions.
We travelled by night and worked by day,
hastening on to the completion of our task. At times,
arriving at our destination in the middle of the night,
we rested, exhausted, in the ladies’ waiting-room at
the railway station, where there were cane-seated
settees, on which we spread our travelling rugs and
remained until the morning. A native woman was
always in charge, and good refreshment-rooms were at
hand, so that we saved much time and avoided publicity
in this way. We often travelled in what were
known as “intermediate compartments,” knowing
that we should attract less attention than as first or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
second-class passengers. We simply asked for guidance
at every step of the way through these months of
anxiety and toil; and we knew that our prayers were
answered.</p>

<p>We had various interpreters. One of these was a
specially gifted woman. She had a sweet, plaintive
voice, and sang the native songs with touching effect on
the poor women whom we visited; one we always recall
as having been a wonderful instrument through God of
moving their hearts. It was a pilgrim hymn with a
recurring strain of warning against the love of the
world, dress, jewellery, and sinful pleasures; and reminding
us all that this life is swiftly passing, and that
death may soon overtake us. Often before the refrain
was finished the poor women would be seen sobbing as
they listened, joining in the sorrowful strain that recurred
again and again; and as soon as the song was ended
pouring out their pitiful histories and their protests
against the degradation into which they had been thrust
by the infamous system of legalised vice under which
they were slaves.</p>

<div>
  <img class="dropcap-a" src="images/letter_a.png" width="46" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="dropcap-a">A <span class="smcap">vivid</span> scene comes before us: We are sitting
on a mortar bench, built in a circular form
around the trunk of an old tree, in the open
court of a Government chakla in one of the
Cantonments of India. Some thirty or forty
girls come trooping around us, either sitting down on
the ground, native style, or bringing their cot-beds with
them for seats.</p>

<p>Our sweet-voiced interpreter sings a plaintive song—native
words and native tune—and when she has finished
there is scarcely a dry eye to be seen. Then follows a
simple Gospel message to which all give respectful heed,
and at its close we ask, “Why are you in such a place as
this?” Several answer in brief monosyllables, accompanied
by a gesture as though drawing a line transversely
across the brow. “It is our fate! It is our fate!” are
the words used in reply; and our interpreter explains to
us that these believe, in accordance with their religious
instructions, that while they were yet babes, in an unfortunate
moment, when left alone by the mother, the messenger
of fate entered the room and wrote the word
“prostitute” in invisible characters across the brow, and
that from that moment to struggle against the lot that
awaited them would have been useless.</p>

<p>No wonder that such poor slaves, when once taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and placed with the British soldiers by some wicked
mahaldarni, never dream of trying to get away; and
small wonder if others who had hoped that a better fate
might await them, and who make one ignorant, feeble
attempt to escape (and the women of a people whose
customs keep them in perpetual seclusion are extremely
ignorant of the outside world) and are recaptured by the
police, will never be induced to try again, but quickly
become convinced that their fate has been also inexorably
fixed from the cradle.</p>

<p>“But,” we say, “God is too good; He would not have
it so.” And they reply hopelessly, “But what can we
do? We cannot starve; we cannot cut our own throats.
Oh, that we might die!”</p>

<p>Then they begin to clamour for a chance to tell their
individual stories. One is a girl who was left an orphan
at the age of six years. At the tender age of eleven she
says she was taken by an Englishman and kept three
years as his mistress. When he deserted her, there was
no door open to receive her but the chakla. One pretty
girl said she had been deceived by a bad woman, under
promise of employment.</p>

<p>Another, with face partly covered by her hands for
very shame, said her husband had sold her to the mahaldarni
for money. By graphic gesture and with the
help of the few English words she knew, another told of
the agonies of slow starvation until at last her courage
gave way, and she came to the British soldiers, who were
willing to feed her starving body for the sake of its
worth as an instrument of self-indulgence. This is the
only right to existence accorded to many women, even
in so-called Christian countries, where labour is hard to
obtain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>A little girl of ten, gaudily arrayed in the style of the
others, thus publishing her candidature for a life of vice
before she knew its meaning in the least, played about
among the older ones. A little boy of two, with beautiful
forehead, and other features that betrayed his
English blood, had been forsaken by his father, who had,
the girls said, “gone home to England.” We recall
having seen other children of Saxon type at Lucknow,
Meerut, and at Peshawar, left in the same way by
fathers who were officers of the British army in India.
While the attempt is being made to create sentiment in
favour of protecting the “innocent wives and children”
of British soldiers, it might be well to inquire which
wives and which children—those that already exist in
India, or those that have not yet materialised in England.
God knows which are the real wives and the real
children of soldiers who have, in many cases in the past,
entered into a contract with unsophisticated native
women who never dreamed that it was anything less
than lawful marriage!</p>

<p>“These bad women promise us everything and then
betray us into this life,” said several of the girls, referring
to the treachery of the mahaldarnis. They told us of a
girl who had recently been set on fire by an angry
soldier, and had been burned to death, and related the
story of cruelties practised upon them by drunken
soldiers. A native guard in uniform drew near to listen.
These military guards were there all the time, and were
changed every few hours, the girls told us. As the mahaldarnis
who own the girls are always at hand to watch
against the escape of the discontented, the work of the
guard seems to be chiefly to keep order and to prevent
the entrance of native men, as the latter are strictly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
forbidden to associate with women kept for the English
soldiers.</p>

<p>Two women of mature years now approached, and we
were informed that they were the mahaldarnis. One
lived there all the time, and the other was there with her
girls for the time being. They said they had each a
salary of ten rupees a month from the Government.
They also took a share of the girls’ earnings. Another
time we went to the hut, close to the chakla, where one
of them lived, and she proudly displayed to us some of
the recommendations she held from British officers.
They were grim and horrid reading; we will give but a
single <span class="no-break">illustration:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Ameer has supplied the 2nd Derby Regiment with prostitutes
for the past three years, and I recommend her to any other regiment
requiring her for a similar capacity.</p>

<p class="alignRight"><span style="margin-right: 10em;">“S. G. M——,</span></p>

<p class="alignRight"><span style="margin-right: 5em;"><i>“Quartermaster 2nd Derby Regiment.”</i></span></p>

</blockquote>

<p>As to the methods to which these mahaldarnis resort
to procure girls, it has been touched upon in the
personal stories of girls already given, and will be emphasized
necessarily more and more as our story continues.
Mahaldarni Rahiman, met in another Cantonment,
told us a story closely resembling the methods
described in a former chapter (page 20), by a Government
official. She said in substance: “If a girl is not
sufficiently attractive to earn a living, I send her away
and get another in her place. I get the women from the
bazaar when more are needed. I go to the Cantonment
magistrate, and he gives me five, ten, twenty, or fifty
rupees, as the case may demand. To buy a very young,
attractive girl I will be furnished with fifty rupees. There
is always plenty of money to get them with.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>When opportunity afforded, we called upon the other
mahaldarni, and she likewise showed us her recommendations
in the handwriting of British military officials,
and other interesting papers which she had carefully
preserved. There was an original copy of her appointment
as mahaldarni to a certain regiment, closing with
permission for her to go to Ferozepore to attend to
“certain business of her bazaar.” This was signed by
the Colonel of the regiment. There was a letter
written to her by the Staff-Surgeon of the same
regiment, a few days later, <span class="no-break">saying:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Mahaldarni, Seventh Lancers,—You have not brought your
women from Meerut and Ferozepore. You will have to do it
or the Colonel will think you have broken faith, as it is now fifteen
days since you received your appointment.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The Staff-Surgeon evidently thought it an easy task
to buy or entrap twelve or fifteen girls in as many days.
Then there was a copy of a letter addressed by herself
to the Cantonment magistrate, which she had employed
some one to write in English for her. This letter stated
that she had brought four new girls with her who had
several thousand rupees’ worth of jewelry with them
(probably a lie by way of excuse), but their brothers had
accompanied them (to effect their rescue?) and she asked
the magistrate to require the girls to remain in the
chakla, and then their brothers could not get near them.
Native men not being allowed about the chakla, brothers
and husbands who might be bent upon the rescue of
female members of their families, who had been enticed
away or stolen by the mahaldarnis, could be kept at a
safe distance.</p>

<p>At other times we had opportunities to revisit this
large chakla. There were about one hundred inmates,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and accommodations for many more. The building was
scarcely less than a huge fortification. High blank
walls—excepting tiny well-barred windows high up,
surrounded an open space of ground, or court; and the
inner side of the wall was lined with small numbered
rooms for the accommodation of the inmates. Most of
the girls, here as elsewhere, because of constant association
with British men, had learned to speak a little
English, while a few spoke quite fluently. Although we
always were accompanied by a good interpreter, yet often
we were able to converse quite freely ourselves with the
girls.</p>

<p>Our interpreter recognised one girl on our first visit,
whom we shall call by her nickname, which was “Katy,”
and asked her if she was not the girl who had run after
her carriage two or three times, begging the interpreter
to take her away. Katy said she had done so, and with
streaming tears reiterated her desire to escape from a life
of which she was so ashamed, and pleaded with us to take
her. When we consented to take her that very day, she
faltered, and then decided that she did not dare try to
go until after the following day, which was the day of the
bi-weekly examination, but she said that if we would
give her our address she would come herself on the day
following. As we drove away in our cab, and the girls
waved farewell, poor Katy, with pitiful and despairing
countenance, burst into tears. Her face haunted us for
days, and as she did not come of her own accord to us,
in a few days we went after her again.</p>

<p>We learned afterwards that Katy had made ineffectual
attempts to come to us. When we returned to the
chakla for her, we found her without difficulty, and
told her our errand. With glowing, happy face, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
arrayed herself in her best garments, arranged her hair
neatly and with childish simplicity, and leaving her few
earthly belongings behind, got into the cab with us.
But soon her face clouded, she grew apprehensive, and
said she would have to go and get permission of the
Cantonment magistrate before she could venture to
leave. Anticipating not the slightest difficulty in this
matter, when we represented the case to the magistrate
and became surety for the girl’s future good conduct and
maintenance by a responsible Mission, we decided that it
was best to let her have her own way. We did not then
know India as we learned it afterwards. But the native
policemen, seeing the girl with us, and being informed
or suspecting our errand, refused, on enquiry, to inform
us where the Cantonment magistrate could be found, and
misled us in so far as they gave us any information.</p>

<p>We had a long, wearisome search, from which we
learned somewhat of the difficulties that a poor Government
slave-girl would encounter in trying, unaided, to
disentangle herself from a life in the chakla. We took
Katy away in the morning; we drove about, back and
forth, mile upon mile, being sent hither and thither by
misleading directions, and at last, considerably after
mid-day, reached the magistrate’s court, and entered.
We were received with respect and given seats. In the
course of our search, the girl had told us that her real
fear of leaving without the magistrate’s consent grew out
of the fact that she had made one attempt to run away,
and had been caught and fined, and had not yet paid the
fine. She felt that if she went away again, without
permission, it would only be to be ferreted out and fined
yet more heavily. The timid girl, however, did not dare
admit the whole truth to us, lest we might not consent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to take her at all. Afterwards, we learned it from most
reliable sources.</p>

<p>The girl had a very wicked mother and sister. An
Englishman, who had known her from childhood, said
that Katy had frequently come to him, saying she
wished to be good and wanted to learn to read; but no
way opened, apparently, for her to get free from the
evil influences by which she was surrounded; and at
last she was overcome, and became the “kept woman”
of a British soldier at an early age. The soldier brought
drink to their house, which she, in ignorance of the
very strict laws to the contrary, permitted him to do.
A native woman in the household of the man who
related the facts to us, complained to the magistrate,
and Katy was summoned to appear before him for
punishment.</p>

<p>Frightened at the prospect, she managed to escape
to a neighbouring village, was apprehended, brought
back, sentenced to seven months’ imprisonment, and a
fine of fifty rupees for contempt of court. When she
had served out her sentence (three months before we
knew her) the mahaldarni was allowed (Katy said) to
take her into custody and become surety for the fine.
The English gentleman could not tell us whether the
girl’s statement that the mahaldarni was allowed to
become her security was correct or not; but he believed
it to be, from the fact that it was then that she went to
the chakla and for the first time became a common
prostitute. Learning these facts afterwards, we did not
longer wonder that Katy had feared to try to come away
without the magistrate’s consent, and had shown such
lack of courage when she faced him.</p>

<p>Almost immediately upon our seating ourselves in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the court-room the poor girl burst into tears and ran
outside and hid round a corner. It was with great
difficulty that we persuaded her to come back and
face the magistrate, who apparently was treating her
with the utmost kindness. After considerable parleying
in Hindustani and English, the magistrate at last
acceded to our wishes, and wrote out a permit for us
to take the girl away from the Cantonment, although he
explained again and again that she or any other woman
was of course free to go; they never attempted to detain
a woman against her will, etc., etc. But Katy was not
willing to proceed on any uncertainty, and she then asked
about the fine, and was assured that would be all right.</p>

<p>The magistrate then explained that she had been
arrested on “some criminal charge,”—he did not quite
know what—had fled the Cantonment, been arrested
and brought back and fined fifty rupees for contempt of
court. He made no mention of her long imprisonment
in addition. After that he began to set forth to her, in
Hindustani (the meaning of his threats we did not
fully understand), that if she went out of the Cantonment
she would never be safe from the insults of soldiers,
nor protected from molestation, nor allowed ever again
to see her relatives, etc., etc., until her courage wavered,
and she said, “Then I don’t want to go.” At this he
thundered at her so angrily that once again she ran
from the court-room, and it was with the utmost difficulty
we persuaded her to go back for the final adjustment
of the case. On her return she began to plead
to be allowed to see her friends; and the magistrate,
then turning to us, advised us in a kindly tone to take
her to see her mother and sister before removing her
entirely from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>This the girl herself desired, so we felt obliged to
accede, and she gave the cabman the address in
Hindustani. Returning in the carriage, down an unfamiliar
street, we alighted, and Katy ran ahead in all
haste to find her mother, while we followed after. To
our astonishment, we found we had entered the chakla
again, from a side we had not recognised, and by an
entrance which we had never before seen. We took
alarm at once, and hastened on toward the wretched old
woman who lay ill on a cot on the verandah, with whom
Katy was talking earnestly.</p>

<p>A big, coarse woman (this was Katy’s sister, but it
must not be forgotten that we at this time did not know
that her family were so disreputable) came out and sat
down on the cot by the sick woman; but as soon as she
heard enough of the girl’s pleading to know that she
was asking permission to escape from her wretched
existence, she flew into a passion and struck Katy, and
blow would have followed blow had we not interfered.
Poor Katy flung herself dejectedly into a chair, and
could not summon up courage to follow us against all
this opposition; then a British soldier came up and
spoke to her and led her away, while two or three more
British soldiers looked on in contemptuous amusement
at the scene. The poor creature was too cowed in
spirit, from constant bad usage, to resist the determination
of officials and soldiers to keep possession of so
attractive a slave.</p>

<p>Weigh the soul of that one dark-skinned heathen girl
against the diseased bodies of a standing army of men,
and God knows which has most weight in his sight, even
if a whole materialistic nation may have forgotten.
Men and women, Governments and Armies, cannot,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
combined, reduce the estimate which He puts upon one
immortal soul; but in a near judgment-day, these will
have to drink the full measure appointed for such a
crime as thwarting a woman in her God-given right to
lead a decent moral life. When a Government begins to
drag down the moral character of its subjects, it has
begun to dig out its own foundations.</p>

<p>We talked with over three hundred Cantonment
women, held to prostitution by the iron law of military
regulation, collected together by Government procuresses,
who were used as the ultimate tools of administration in
carrying out Lord Roberts’ military order for a sufficient
number of attractive women, forced to the indecent
exposure of their persons by misnamed “doctors,”
under penalty of fine or expulsion from the Cantonment,
which was tantamount to starvation; imprisoned
for several days of each month, even when in perfect
health, in the Lock Hospital; imprisoned for an
indefinite length of time in the hospital whenever found
diseased; often turned out when seriously diseased, with
their British children, to starve, or to spread disease at
will among the natives, the final scapegoats of British
profligacy; dismissed to starvation when too old to be any
longer “sufficiently attractive” to the soldier, if only
a fresh victim could be found to take the place; universally
so poor as to be weighed down by debts, and
receiving a pittance fixed by military usage, that kept
many of them on the verge of starvation.</p>

<p>What were the circumstances that brought women to
such a lot as this? We will give only a few, in bare
outlines, of the many cases not already <span class="no-break">mentioned:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. A nurse-maid enticed to the chakla by a British sergeant.</p>

<p>2. A wife brought by her own husband, the man himself being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>engaged by an officer of the regiment as a servant, and allowed to
hold his unwilling wife in such servitude.</p>

<p>3. British, granddaughter of a former Governor-General, daughter
of a General, wife of a Commissioner; eloped with a soldier, and
when deserted entrapped by a Mohammedan and kept as a slave,
to whom British soldiers resorted in troops, almost, because a
white woman; they paid the price of shame to her native master;
rescued when almost dead. We found her in a miserably dirty
bed at a native Lock Hospital, where the Government allowed her
four annas (about fourpence) a day for subsistence. We ourselves
rescued another British woman from the clutches of the same
Mohammedan slave-holder. We found her in a fortified room,
built on the top of a large house, a neck-breaking outside stairway
leading to her abode. She had suffered horribly at the hands of
the British soldiers admitted to her. Her reason was injured
beyond repair. In the absence of her master, she was guarded by
a native servant armed with a knife, who had been instructed in
her presence to plunge it into her if she tried to escape. A very
courageous gentleman accompanied us, and succeeded in so
frightening her master that we were permitted to lead her away.</p>

<p>4. An orphan seized by a wicked woman and reared to shame.</p>

<p>5. A young girl brought by her own brother and sold to the
chakla.</p>

<p>6. Cabul girl of high birth who lost her father in the Afghan
war. She was only twelve when left without protection, and her
father’s groom persuaded her to come away with him under
promise of marriage; sold by him to shame. She wept bitterly,
exclaiming, “Oh, the shame of being pointed out as a bazaar
woman!” We asked her why she did not go to the Cantonment
magistrate and plead her own case, for she said she had money
secreted with which she could take care of herself, if once she
could get away. She replied, “Why should I tell him? I am
only a black woman; I fear him.” When about to return to the
south, we revisited this station and hunted this woman up, offering
to assist her to escape; but her courage failed at the last moment,
and we were obliged to leave her behind to her fate.</p>

<p>7. An Egyptian woman from Cairo, enticed away from her home
when a child and sold to an old woman in Quetta, then carried
to India.</p>

<p>8. A Kashmiri woman; ill-treated by her husband, she ran away
with another man who promised to make her his wife, but sold her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>into shame. “It is a bad job; I don’t like it,” she said in the best
English she could control, while the tears were in her eyes.</p>

<p>9. A hill girl of respectable family lost her parents and her
husband (perhaps only betrothed, yet possibly already married),
before ten years of age. A deceitful woman came to comfort her
in her grief and unprotected condition, and enticed her to travel
with her a month to assuage her grief; sold her to a British
official, with whom she lived one year, when he died. She then
became a chakla woman. She was only sixteen. She said, “It is
a bitter life.”</p>

<p>10. A high-caste Brahmin girl, not able to understand a word of
the language of her captor, found deserted and starving. The
captor admitted that she was a perfectly respectable girl, yet she
was examined by the surgeon, her name entered on the list of
prostitutes, and taken to the Lock Hospital to be prepared for her
fate. The poor thing was so grateful to be taken in and fed, and
little dreamt of what would be demanded of her in return. We
tried in vain to make her understand us, and to warn her of her
fate.</p>

<p>11. Taken in famine time by the daughter of a sepoy (native
soldier). The soldier sold her at eleven years of age “to sit in the
chakla.” “In all the years of my life, I have not known one day
of happiness; my heart is full of wounds,” was her pathetic
ending of the story.</p>

<p>12. We witnessed the purchase of a girl by a mahaldarni. A
woman seized the girl as payment for a debt, and bringing her
sold her to the mahaldarni in our very presence.</p>

<p>13. Married at eleven, and widowed almost immediately. After
three years with her family as a widow, she was so miserable that
she ran away and wandered in the streets. She was arrested by
the police, and at the age of fourteen put in the chakla.</p>

<p>14. Her husband was beating her cruelly, at the age of fourteen,
and she ran away; a policeman seized her and sent her to the
Lock Hospital.</p>

<p>15. Deserted at the age of eleven by her husband; a British
man took her by force to his bungalow. When he discarded her,
her family would not receive her again. She was then “taken by
the Government and put in the chakla.”</p>

</div>
<p class="dropcap-i"><span class="smcap letter-spaced">In</span> March, 1892, we arrived at a huge Cantonment
about midnight. As there was no dak bungalow
at the place, we spread our rugs on the
settees in the ladies’ waiting-room, and slept
till morning. The dak bungalow is an institution
kept up by the Government for the convenience
of military men and their families, although other
travellers take advantage of its shelter, and was
preferable to an hotel for our purpose, for our meals
were served in our private rooms always, and we could
lead a very retired life. After breakfast in the dining-room,
we went out and engaged a cab, explaining, as
was our custom, to the driver, that we were Christian
missionaries, and in accordance with the teachings of
our religion, we were searching out the most despised
and disreputable of women, to tell them of God’s care
for them and to see what we could do for them;
therefore we wished him to drive us to see the chakla
women of the Cantonment. He looked a little bewildered,
and then drove off with us.</p>

<p>After traversing a considerable distance, he entered a
public garden, and began to drive slowly, that we might
enjoy the flowers and foliage. We called to him, bidding
him drive on rapidly, as we did not care to see the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
sights of the Cantonment. He nodded assent, and
touching his horse with the whip, drove away in another
direction. Presently he paused before another object to
which he was accustomed to take visitors. Then we
called him from his seat to the cab window, and told
him that if he took us out of our way again, we should
be obliged to leave his cab, call another, and dismiss
him. We made sure he understood exactly what we
wished, and he admitted that he did, but intimated that
he scarcely thought it a proper place for us to visit.
However, he consented, and drove off, and in a few
moments brought us to an open field where two regiments
were encamped. Fortunately, some drill of an
unusual sort was going on, and a good many people had
driven out to witness it; this, therefore, absorbed the
attention of all. The Lord appointed all our seasons
for us during our Indian investigations.</p>

<p>Taking a road leading to the back part of the camp,
we left our cab and driver where several other cabs were
standing, and walking along together, observed by no
one, entered one of the ten little tents we found enclosed
in a sort of fence of matting. The women received us
cordially, although with real astonishment at such
unusual visitors. The mahaldarni was not a bad-meaning
woman in many regards, and she told us, with great
satisfaction, of a sister of hers who had been promoted
from the rank of a common soldiers’ woman to be a
mahaldarni, saying that she had left off her wickedness,
prayed four times a day and read her Koran. She
joined with her girls in expressions of utter abhorrence
of the examinations to which the girls were subjected,
saying, “Shame! Shame!”</p>

<p>She told us how the soldiers, when in drink, knocked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the poor girls about in a most cruel manner, and reaching
her own conclusion as to the meaning of our call,
advised us not to join their number, telling us that the
city was far preferable. She and the girls told of the
heavy fines to which they would be liable if they did
not go to the examinations, or attempted to leave the
Lock Hospital when held there. She said if they made
any fuss about the fine, then they would be imprisoned.
A military guard was placed within the enclosure, in one
of the tents; but he had either gone to sleep, or
wandered out to get a view of the exercises that were
going on near by. We gave a simple gospel talk
through our interpreter, and she sang and prayed with
the girls; then we made our way to the women of the
adjoining Rest Camp.</p>

<p>Again we entered the enclosure surrounding the little
tents, and reached the women without attracting the
attention of the guard. They told the same story of
compulsion and fines continually hanging over their
heads. Almost every Cantonment girl we ever questioned,
was held to her wretched life by debt and fines, so
that she could not think of getting free without being
apprehended on account of them. Here likewise they
warned us not to join them, but go rather to the city.
Again we talked of Jesus, the Friend of the oppressed,
and after song and prayer, bade them good-bye.</p>

<p>Returning to our cab, we told our driver to take us to
the Lock Hospital; and after a long drive under the
burning sun, we stopped before buildings enclosed
within a very high brick wall with broken glass on its
top to prevent the escape of inmates. A large, strongly-spiked
gateway, with double doors, gave the impression
of a veritable prison; and there, standing in the open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
gateway, was an uniformed armed guard. Previous experiences
had not led us to expect anything quite so
formidable, although there was generally some sort of a
guard or watchman at hand, and the native physician
usually resided on the premises. We had often said,
and promised God, that, sacred as was the nature of the
work, we would never prevaricate in order to cover up
our real object, if closely questioned. We were not
ordinary detectives, playing a part, but Christian
women, and the difference was not to be lost sight of.</p>

<p>Our interpreter had not been instructed as to the full
significance of our work, but was content to ask few
questions if only she might be allowed to follow her bent
freely and preach the gospel, which we gladly encouraged
and helped in every way possible, for we should have
felt that our mission was very incomplete had we met
these women solely to hear their pitiful stories, and never
utter a word to them of the love of the Heavenly Father,
in the midst of such distressing surroundings. Our
interpreter always carried religious tracts with her; and
while we were hesitating to know how to encounter the
armed sentinel, in the simplicity of her holy zeal she
walked up to him, gave him a tract, and said a few
words of a helpful nature. The guard noticed no more
than that some ladies were being delayed at the gate,
so he motioned us through, continuing his consideration
of the leaflet, and forgetting to ask our errand. How
easy for God to hide his own as He had hidden us again
and again that day from guard and sentinel! We have
frequently been asked how we escaped observation. We
can only say that we made but little effort on our own
part to do this, and trusted the Lord to do it all for us.</p>

<p>A dozen women gathered around us in a ward of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
hospital that day. With them we had a little service,
as usual, after which they eagerly poured out their sad
life stories, and told of the oppressions of the system
under which they were held in an evil life. The hospital
nurse showed us through the wards and the examination
room, where we found the grim rack for the
torture of the examination, brutal to the patient, but
convenient for the surgeon to do as much villainy as
possible in a given length of time. No diseases are so
rife or dreadful in their consequences but that their
compulsory treatment, when it involves the indecent
exposure of woman or man, is worse in its effects than
the disease itself. And this in the case of actual disease.
What, then, can be said as an excuse for such exposure
simply to find out whether there be disease? Yes,
further, what possible plea can be made when the object
of such compulsory exposure is to discover whether the
subject is “fit”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> for a life of infamy?</p>

<p>Mrs. Butler has well expressed the encouragement to
vice that the compulsory examination of women leads to
in the following words: “We all approve of healing
disease and taking care of the sick, no matter what has
brought on their disease, no matter how sinful and
degraded they may be. The Abolitionists have always
pleaded for plenty of free hospital accommodation
for men and women afflicted with this curse. But it
will be clear to you that this law is not for simple
healing, as Christ would have us heal, caring for all,
whatever their character, and whatever their disease.
This law is invented to provide beforehand, that men
may be able to sin without bodily injury—if that were
possible, which it is not. If a burglar, who had broken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>into my house and stolen my goods, were to fall and be
hurt, I would be glad to get him into a hospital and
have him nursed and cured; but I would not put a
ladder up against my window at night and leave the
windows open, in order that he might steal my goods
without danger of breaking his neck.”</p>

<p>But to return to the Lock Hospital mentioned. The
nurse produced the records for our examination. In the
correspondence book was the copy of a letter from the
military surgeon, informing the Cantonment magistrate
of six girls suspected of disease, and asking that they be
apprehended and sent to the hospital for examination.
That looked simple enough, and why not?</p>

<p>Imagine yourself the one apprehended, and the case
assumes a different aspect. A policeman comes to your
door and reads a warrant for your arrest as a common
prostitute; you ask on what authority; you are informed
that the name of the informant is not made public,
because if a man can be induced to help trace out
diseases—it being regarded as a “point of honour” to
inform other men where danger lurks—his confession
must not be made known, it would injure his reputation.
(We are now describing the exact conditions always
existent where there is compulsory examination of
women.)</p>

<p>You contend that you have a right to your good
name, and that it is a principle of justice that no one can
be punished on secret and unproved evidence, and that
it is punishment of the worst sort to be taken by a
policeman through the streets to a hospital used exclusively
for the treatment of a certain class of disorders.
You are then informed that unless you will go at once
without any trouble, you will be taken out of the town
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
in which you live, set down as a common vagrant by the
roadside, and if ever again found within the limits of the
city in which your parents, brothers, and sisters live,
you will be arrested and put in jail. What will you
do? Yet these were exactly the laws under which
these poor women, among whom we were spending
the day, lived.</p>

<p>By such a system of delivering over the bodies of
women as public property, any woman of humble circumstances
upon whom any man of lecherous design
casts his eyes, could be made to come to his terms of
existence by the aid of the police force, if necessary, and
magistrates of evil design could condemn any woman to
a life of prostitution. And in this hospital all this wicked
compulsion was set down in a book, every page of which
was headed, “Prostitutes attending Voluntary Inspections.”</p>

<p>From the Lock Hospital we drove to a large chakla,
and talked with a group of about twenty girls, among
them a little girl of twelve, and another of four. Everywhere
we went among the degraded women of India, we
found children in the chaklas, these Government-regulated
brothels, with their ever-present guards, so that
Englishmen knew perfectly that children were being
trained under Government regulation for prostitution.
The advocates of licensed prostitution for India are fond
of insisting as an excuse for licensing the evil, that it
does no great harm because the recruits come from “the
prostitute caste.” Repeatedly we made enquiries of
Englishmen, native physicians, and in one case applied
to the census office for some information concerning
this special class. Its existence was practically denied,
excepting those cases which can be found in every land,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
in which women of all classes may fall into shame and
train their daughters after their own evil ways. It is
scarcely necessary in this connection to mention the
temple and nautch girls of India, who are found in civil
lines. They are a wholly distinct class from the enslaved
women who are set apart to minister to the vices of the
British soldiers. Among the latter we found Hindus of
all castes, from high-caste Brahmins down; and we also
found Mohammedans, Arabs, Egyptians, Afghans, Kashmiris,
Jewesses,—recruits, in fact, from those among
whom “caste” does not prevail. If it were true that all
these chakla women constitute one caste, for what object
did the Government of India, in times past, provide
invariably (so far as our observation extends) for a record
of the “caste” of the women to whom registration tickets
were given? The ticket which we purchased of a woman
at Meean Meer in 1892 (a fac-simile of which is given in
this volume, <a class="deco-none" href="#Appendix_B"><i>Appendix B</i></a>) recorded her “name,” “caste,”
“registered number,” “place of residence,” “date of
registry,” and “personal appearance.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>But there is a class in India being trained to prostitution,
though not a “caste,” properly speaking, and
they are getting their training in the brothels established
and managed by Englishmen, and many of the candidates
in this class are the children of Englishmen, who
have been deliberately placed there, or allowed to go
there, by their inhuman fathers. This is, properly
speaking, the prostitute class of India, those born to
their fate; the reader may judge whether the existence
of the class justifies licensing it for the purpose.</p>

<p>In the chakla we sang, “Where He leads me I will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>follow,” and its interpretation constituted our Gospel
message. With tears in their eyes the girls assured us,
with characteristic gesture, that we were “on their eyes
and on their hearts”; in other words, had won their affections;
and spoke feelingly of the honour it was to them
that Englishwomen should come to see them, saying
that usually Englishmen forbade their wives to even look
at them. One girl said that when at Cawnpore missionaries
used to come to them, and that for days after
their visits her heart was so sore that it seemed as if it
would burst. The girls stood in the doorway, many of
them with streaming eyes, and waved good-bye as we
departed, begging us to come again soon.</p>

<p>We hastened to the railway station for the three
o’clock train. When we alighted, we spoke a few kind
words to our cabman, for he had served us most faithfully,
all these hours under the mid-day glare of the sun,
after so unpromising a beginning. We wished to pay
him well, and asked him to set his own price on his
services. The simple, rough native man hesitated a
moment, stammered something unintelligible, burst into
tears, and averting his face with noble shame, said, “I
don’t want anything at all. I never saw anything like
this before; I would like to help, too.” Thrusting a
coin into his unwilling hand, ample for both fee and
present, we hastened to our seats in the car, and were
soon rolling away to our next destination. We wrote
up our notes of the day’s doings on the way, and arrived
at our next field of operations the following morning at
two o’clock, stealing into another Cantonment unobserved,
excepting by the Heavenly Father, without
whom not even a sparrow can fall. We give this
history of one day as a sample; the work was heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and painful; but we encouraged each other often with
the words, “Even if we fall by the way, we could not die
in better work.”</p>

<p>We visited a Rest Camp at Meerut. As usual, we
had no difficulty in passing the sentinels; God took
care of that. We learnt from official records that the
regiment had only been in India two weeks; yet the
complete paraphernalia of vice was at hand. There
were fourteen little tents for women, and near their
quarters a huge tent pitched for those who wished to
smoke opium. Think of it, fathers and mothers, boys
of the age of from eighteen years upwards, supplied by
their superior officers, before they could have made a
demand for the same, with every convenience for giving
themselves over to debauchery! The sight of their fresh
young faces touched us deeply.</p>

<p>At another place, away up on the northern frontier,
we found only five girls; the others had somehow
escaped their cruel bondage. As we entered the gateway
of the mud wall that surrounded their quarters, a
native man standing near threw up his hands in great
astonishment, exclaiming, “O God! (‘Allah’), how
wonderful that ladies should come to such a place!” It
was a dreary, weird scene. The evening was piercingly
cold, and we were well wrapped. The old mahaldarni
and her girls were trying to warm themselves by a
wretched little pot of charcoal, stretching their thin
fingers by turns over the coals.</p>

<p>While we talked, the sudden night of a country
without a twilight came on, although it was not really
very late. One of the girls lighted a native lamp of the
rudest sort—a bit of wick floating in an earthenware cup
of oil—and set it in a niche in the wall. The room was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
unfurnished excepting the <i>charpoy</i>, or cot bed, on which
we sat. The girls and mahaldarni sat, native fashion,
on the floor, their cotton chuddars and skirts fluttering
in the cruel wind that came in at the open archway, for
door there was none.</p>

<p>They said the men of their regiment were very bad,
and often when drunk beat them and robbed them, not
only refusing to pay them any money, but even taking
away their cotton quilts and selling them to their own
native servants for a few pice with which to buy drink.
They described the case of one woman who was beaten
terribly by a soldier, and cut in the arms and breast;
after this, several of the girls had effected their escape.
We have often spoken of this as one of the most deeply
shaded pictures in our memory, not only because of the
dreary, comfortless surroundings, but because of the
cruelty and oppression that weighed these helpless women
down, from which there seemed no hope of escape. We
talked to them out of the fullness of our sympathy, and
promised to pray and work in their behalf, that they, and
others like them, might have an opportunity to turn to a
good life.</p>

<p>But turning from the physical injury inflicted on these
poor women, we wish to present a view of their mental
sufferings. It has been urged by many advocates of the
regulation of vice that the whole nature of a woman was
changed by her sinful life—that she had no sensitiveness
and no deep sense of the degradation of her position.
We utterly deny this on behalf of the scores of women
with whom we have talked in India—whether of high or
of low caste, Hindoo or Mohammedan, and of whatever
nationality; whether brought up in virtue and afterwards
betrayed, or brought up from infancy in vicious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
surroundings. We deny it even in regard to the mahaldarnis
placed over the women, whom avarice might
blind, and the ordinary routine duties of their position
might harden. Yet when their womanly feelings were
appealed to, they always responded, and felt shame with
and for the women under their care.</p>

<p>In all our conversations there was shown a most
remarkable patience, on the part of the women, in
regard to the various inconveniences and hardships
which the regulations entailed upon them. The fire of
their hatred and indignation all centred upon <i>the
heart of the regulations, the examinations</i>, and the violation
of womanhood which these examinations were
felt to be. It is of no use for any one to deny to us that
these women have deep feelings in regard to their
wrongs and their shame. We have felt the beating of
their aching hearts against our own; we have heard
histories that throbbed with the strong agony of betrayed
innocence; we have seen a hopeless woe in eyes
that will haunt us for ever.</p>

<p>At Peshawar, the women said, when speaking of the
great hardship of being turned out of the Cantonment,
“Where can we go to? We are prostitutes.
No one would give us work.” And again, “Every
one under this Government is treated well but ourselves;
<i>we only are despised</i>.”</p>

<p>We do not present these facts with any thought of
taking our position with those who argue that the
better regulation of vice implies a better protection of
the degraded women; but rather to show that in the
working out of such regulations the <i>woman</i> is absolutely
lost sight of, and only the <i>prostitute</i> is considered.
Every interest in the woman’s character, happiness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
health, life itself, is made subservient to the health and
convenience of the British soldier. Every assertion
that would put a humanitarian gloss on the regulation
of vice is utter hypocrisy.</p>

<p>At Meerut, where there were a good many women
present, one, without any question whatever on our
part, suddenly broke forth into the most intense expressions
of disgust at the Governmental regulation of vice,
in which those girls gathered about her sympathized,
one especially taking part in the conversation from
time to time, and corroborating what was being said.
She said, “The Queen does not approve of this; it is
the Commander-in-Chief and the officers who are doing
these things! Oh, what a shame that the Government
does these things!” Then she burst into a passion of
indignation, describing in vivid language and with a
natural eloquence of gesture the whole shameful proceeding,
and the humiliation to which they were subjected.</p>

<p>Words fail to convey the force, and fire, and pathos
with which that poor, untaught woman pleaded the
cause of her sisters. It was one voice out of many
protesting against this cruel wrong, and representing
the undying dignity of a woman’s nature, even when
forced into a deeper abyss than she ever voluntarily
chose to enter. We asked if the other women felt as
this one did, and they all answered indignantly, “We
all hate it.” The first woman cried out, “It is very
disgusting; oh, <i>shame</i>!” We told them it was a grief
to us that those who called themselves Christians should
do such things, and that they ought not to bear the
name. She replied bitterly, “Yes; the Commander-in-Chief,
the Colonel, and all of them, all the way down—your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Christian men!—they all favour these things.
The Queen does not countenance it, for she has
daughters of her own; and she cares for her daughters
in India also. It is the Commander-in-Chief” (meaning
Lord Roberts).</p>

<p>The accounts we have given in previous pages reveal
the extremely tender age at which some of these girls
were thrust into a life of shame by court proceedings
under the Contagious Diseases Acts, when they were
openly enforced. Two Benares girls declared they were
taken up by the police at fourteen, and one Sitapur girl
said she was sold to a mahaldarni at eleven. Much has
been said of the horrors of child-marriage in India, and
these atrocities should not be minimized, even though
we bear in mind the usually slender type of Eastern
manhood; but what shall we say when the robust
British soldier has had placed at his mercy a little girl
of fourteen years old, of the delicate Oriental type; and
this done by regular process of law “<i>to preserve his
health</i>”?</p>

<p>Then again considering the heathen training of these
women, we were led to expect that we should find
blindness of the moral sense in relation to this sort of
wrong-doing. On the contrary, they expressed great
shame and humiliation, never tried to justify their sinful
acts, spoke almost universally of their hatred of the life,
shed bitter tears, and told us how burdened their hearts
were in thinking of their sins. Unlike what we met
elsewhere in speaking of religion to the natives, they had
little desire for controversy. With not a single exception,
we were made welcome, treated courteously, and
listened to and blessed for our message. Even in the
case of the mahaldarnis we found them not inaccessible,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
but inclined to expressions of contempt for the whole
system of regulation, and of apology for being the hirelings
of such a system—an excuse which must have
more weight than in a country where industries are
open to women. Rahiman of Meerut was an exception.
She said she considered her business perfectly legitimate,
because she was in a “Government position.”</p>

<p>Several times we asked the women, “What do you
wish us to do for you?” and were surprised at the
answer. Desperately poor as many were, there was
never an appeal for money; rather they said, “Pray for
us;” or, “If you would build us homes, so that we could
go to them, and not sin any more, what more could we
ask?” and, “If you will help us to have the examinations
stopped.” Above all, we were astonished at the
appeals made to us concerning the latter outrage. We
told none of them our whole object in coming among
them, yet with great care they described and expressed
their abhorrence of the examinations, as well as the
wickedness and illegality of them; and in two or three
instances they mentioned that they had heard of ladies
interested in their behalf, and suggested the possibility
that we might do something for them. In one instance
several of the women, after telling us of their humiliation,
clasped their hands together, and lifting their eyes
to heaven, prayed to God that He would “help us to
help them.” They invariably exonerated the Queen
from all blame in this matter, saying, “She is a woman
herself; she would not do this. She cares for her
daughters in India.”</p>

<p>Says Mrs. Josephine Butler: “It is impossible not to
think of the fathers and mothers of the young Englishmen,
mere boys, who go out to India as soldiers, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
who are trained in this disgusting manner by the
military authorities; not only in the indulgence of their
vices, but in cowardly and brutal cruelties towards the
weaker sex. It seemed a grand object indeed on the
part of Lord Roberts and his subordinates to aim at
sending back their discharged soldiers to England free
from physical disease, regardless of their manliness,
their moral character, their respect for women, and
decent habits of life! Would not the loss of these be
bought too dearly by the mere exemption from physical
disease, even if this could be made possible?”</p>

<p>After months of toil, we were now far up towards the
north-western frontier of India. We requested our
cabman to drive us to the quarters of the Government
women of the Cantonment. We left the cab just outside
the narrow street. As we walked past the native shops
and turned into a little sort of lane, a woman shouted
in great concern from her doorway to us, “Why do you
come here? Don’t come here; all are prostitutes who
live here.” With a smile of re-assurance we replied,
“We know it, and you are just the women we are
seeking; we have a message for you.”</p>

<p>With surprise, she then welcomed us most warmly
and invited us in, saying she would go and call all the
women and bring them to hear the message. In a few
minutes chairs had been borrowed for us to sit upon,
and nine native women were clustered on the floor at
our feet.</p>

<p>We both exclaimed regarding the remarkable personal
appearance of the woman who had addressed us first.
She closely resembled, in fine bearing and apparent
intellectuality, a much-beloved mutual friend in Chicago,
a woman of more than local fame in scientific pursuits;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
it touched us deeply. With utmost simplicity and confidence
this woman came and seated herself by Mrs.
Andrew’s side, leaning her arm across her lap, and many
a time during the interview that followed, her earnest,
wistful eyes met ours, while Mrs. Andrew gently stroked
her shoulder, her heart almost breaking with pity as the
woman told her sad story.</p>

<p>A plaintive native song was sung by our interpreter,
and tears flowed freely. After that the simple Gospel
message was given. They told us then some of the
painful details of the conditions under which they were
living, saying that they must either meet these conditions
or be expelled from the Cantonment, and added, “If we
are expelled, where shall we go? we must leave all our
friends, and no one will give us work. It means great
hardship; we would starve.” Speaking of the hateful
examinations, they said the Queen had forbidden these
things, but the officers yet compelled them to go on.</p>

<p>The woman at Mrs. Andrew’s side told us the following:
“Some time ago a lady in Calcutta saw a
woman weeping as she was going to the Lock Hospital
with other women. The lady asked her why she wept.
She told why she was obliged to go, and how she hated
the examinations.</p>

<p>“The lady could not understand this, but took the
woman home with her, and closely questioned into the
matter. Then the lady said to her, ‘This ought not to
be,’ and promised that she would do all she could for
them. Then the lady went home to England and
talked to the Queen. She spoke with wonderful power
in behalf of the poor women of India. She said to the
Queen that she (the Queen) was a woman, and these in
India were women, and their shame was the Queen’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
shame, and for them to be outraged was as though she
(the Queen) was outraged, that it was a shame for <i>women</i>
to be treated so when a woman was Queen. Then the
Queen ordered it to be stopped. But the officers still
carry it on.” This she added sorrowfully, all the other
women joining in the assertion. Then a sudden thought
came into the woman’s face, and she asked: “Are you
like that lady of Calcutta, going to try to do something
to help us?” We told them we would work and pray
for them that help might come and homes be provided
for them. They blessed and thanked us over and over.
We told them, “We are your sisters;” they replied,
“<i>We are your slaves</i>.”</p>

<p>Then the woman whom we have especially described
lifted her hand and with impressive solemnity uttered a
vow that she would no longer lead a life of shame.</p>

<p>The next morning we went back to the same place
and stopped before the open door. The old mother was
sitting on the floor by a little charcoal fire preparing the
breakfast. The two daughters of the house were putting
their simple little abode in order for the day. The
penitent one came forward and smiled so faint a welcome,
and seemed so embarrassed at our coming, that
we at first thought she was offended; but they exclaimed
almost instantly, “We were awake at midnight last night
talking of you, and we said it must have been the true
God who had sent you to tell us of your religion.” We
replied that they had been sorely on our hearts, so that
we could not sleep, and that we too were awake at midnight,
talking of them and praying for them. They then
poured out blessings upon us, with hands clasped in
prayer.</p>

<p>As we talked earnestly and lovingly to them, through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
our interpreter, the one who had made the solemn vow
came forward and knelt beside Mrs. Andrew, who was
standing, and timidly took her hand. Mrs. Andrew laid
it on the poor girl’s shoulder as on the day before, but
the interpreter said, “Put your hand on her head; she is
asking you to bless her.” Tears streamed from the eyes
of the penitent, and she shook with sobs as Mrs. Andrew
fervently blessed her in the name of our God, and
pleaded with Him for the way to open for her escape
from bondage. Then in like manner the other daughter
came and was blessed. Then the poor old mother threw
herself with her forehead on the ground, laying her hands
on Mrs. Andrew’s feet, and while Mrs. Andrew prayed
over her, groaned and cried bitterly, saying, “I am a
sinner, I am a sinner. For twenty-five years I led
a life of shame, and brought up my daughters to it.”</p>

<p>We then wrote down their names, promising to pray
for them, a pledge which we have faithfully kept ever
since.</p>

<p class="dropcap-t"><span class="smcap letter-spaced">The</span> advocates of State-regulated fornication
contend that diseases due to vice will be best
checked by licensed prostitution, combined
with medical care. The Abolitionists hold
that morality alone is sufficient, and that vice
is not necessary. It is a square issue; shall it be
immorality and medicine, or shall it be morality?</p>

<p>The Regulationists believe that vice is necessary; the
Abolitionists believe that vice is not necessary, and
that virtue must be demanded. A memorial signed
by one hundred and twenty-three British women, of
whom over half belong to the titled aristocracy,
presented to the British Government April 24, 1897,
<span class="no-break">declares:—</span></p>

<p>“We feel it is the duty of the State, which of necessity,
collects together large numbers of unmarried men in
military service, to protect them from the consequences
of evils which are, in fact, unavoidable.”</p>

<p>A memorial, on the other hand, of sixty-one
thousand four hundred and thirty-seven British women,
and presented to the Government July 31, 1897,
<span class="no-break">asserts:—</span></p>

<p>“No permanent diminution of disease will ever be
attained by measures which do not strike primarily at
the vice itself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The leader of the sixty-one thousand and more, Mrs.
Josephine Butler, answers to the statement of the one
hundred and twenty-three: “The confidence of ultimate
victory based on a foundation which cannot be shaken,
enables us to regard with composure the forward
advance and claims of materialism and fleshly indulgence,
and to compassionate those—furious against us
to-day—who will be beaten to-morrow, and who will be
forced, before the ‘great cloud of witnesses’ in heaven
and earth, to confess themselves defeated and deserving
of defeat.”</p>

<p>The cause of venereal disease is promiscuous relations
carried to excess. The hope of eradicating such disease,
then, by licensing its cause, betokens the extreme of
moral blindness, and contradicts all science. Dr.
Elizabeth Blackwell says: “We may as well expect to
cure typhoid fever whilst allowing sewer gas to permeate
the house; or cholera, whilst bad drinking water is being
taken, as try to cure venereal disease whilst its cause
remains unchecked.”</p>

<p>A recent official plea for licensed prostitution in the
Cantonments of India declares: “The efforts to teach the
soldiers habits of self-control” have “signally failed.”
We wish for a moment to consider the efforts that have
been used in the past. There lies before us a copy of
the “Report of the Army Health Association.” It was
printed at Meerut, India, in 1892. We have also the
subsequent reports for several years. In speaking of the
efforts put forth to teach self-control, much is made of
the work of this Association (see Departmental Committee
Report, 1897, page 13), as a means that has been
used. This report of the Army Health Association has
printed on its cover such texts as, “Keep thyself pure,”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
“He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption,”
etc.; giving the impression that it is a religious
document. In fact it is interspersed all through with
Scripture quotations.</p>

<p>The introduction is signed by a Major-General, and
the body of the report is written by an army chaplain,
secretary to the Association, who has the title of
Bachelor of Divinity. Four reverends beside, army
chaplains, are named among the list of officers of the
Association. The language employed in the report is
often very obscure, and needs close analysis to get at
its real meaning. The introduction is a plea for the
re-establishment of the abolished system of Regulation,
and is little more than the expression of a desire to have
legal sanction for what they were already doing illegally,
as the report shows, and it is doubtless for this very
reason that the language is so obscure. In one place it
speaks of the “Gospel duty of healing diseases in a
compulsory way,” and as a precedent refers to the
“Gospel record of healing even when a voice had come
from the healed protesting against the cure.” Certainly
blasphemy could scarcely go further than to liken the
compulsory indecent exposure of a woman to a miracle
of our Lord. Every soldier should “do his best,” says
the report, “by the blessing of Almighty God, to resist
all temptation leading to the evil.” Close inspection
proves that in this case “the evil” in the mind of the
writer is not the vice but the disease. The soldier is
recommended to the task of attaining to “self-command
on pass,” <i>i.e.</i>, when outside the region of licensed
brothels.</p>

<p>The report states that a “Handbook” has been
circulated “to all fresh arrivals in India,” and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
closing chapter of the report is a reprint of that
Handbook, which is especially designed for army chaplains
to circulate among the soldiers as a “religious”
tract. Interspersed with the quotations of Scripture
texts, is abominable instruction to the effect that a
young man who will confine his visits to the Government
licensed brothel can trust the Lord to keep him
from contracting disease. This “religious” tract
promises to keep infected women out of the chakla, and
warns the soldier not to go “in an underhand way” to
houses where he will not be protected from “disease.”</p>

<p>O mothers! can you conceive of what would be your
feeling to discover that your eighteen-year-old boy, as is
the son of many an English mother, was under such
“gospel” instruction as this! “We shall never forget
what we owe to Lord Roberts,” says the report; and we
might have anticipated that the author of the “Infamous
Memorandum” would likewise be the supporter of such
measures for the instruction of young soldiers. Sir
George White, who succeeded Lord Roberts as Commander
of the Indian forces, said, in the Viceregal
Council held in India, July 8, 1897, that “Every effort
should also be made to warn young soldiers of the
consequences of immorality in this country, to point out
to them the terrible risks which they run, and to appeal
to their higher moral instincts and to their pride in their
manhood to avoid connections that carry with them
grave danger that they will return home shattered
wrecks, unfit alike for military duty or civil life.”</p>

<p>There is not one word here as though evil connections
were likewise to be avoided, even if they were not
supposed to carry danger of physical disease as a result.
The “moral” teaching seems to have been all of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
immoral sort that points toward the Government house
of shame rather than to the seventh commandment.
How many young soldiers may not have met their first
temptation by having a superior officer point them
to the Government-regulated chakla! Dr. Elizabeth
Blackwell says truly: “The first indispensable condition
in the prevention of disease is the steady discouragement
of promiscuous intercourse. Now I assert positively
that such discouragement has never been seriously tried
in the army, by Government, but only by unofficial
efforts—efforts which are most valuable, but entirely
lacking in the force of organization, and in the important
recognition and help which Government alone
can afford.”</p>

<p>It is easy to <i>assume</i> that the compulsory periodical
examination of women will check diseases due to vice;
but the assumption has never been proved. The statistics
of the years during which the C.&nbsp;D. Acts prevailed
in certain military stations in Great Britain, as
compared with the statistics of later years, show a
marked decrease since repeal took place, and therefore
that the compulsory examinations in no way diminished
disease, but rather the contrary. And when an unbiased
person thoroughly investigates the history of the controversy
on the subject, and is made acquainted with the
course of deceit which has been practised in the past by
Anglo-Indian<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> advocates of licensed vice, in order to
maintain an odious system, a belief in Indian military
assertions will not be inspired. The statement is being
heralded to the world that over half the British army in
India is suffering from diseases due to vice. Yet Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>George Hamilton, Secretary of State for India, was
obliged to explain in the House of Commons, January
25, 1897, that while it had been reported that the aggregate
of admissions to hospital for venereal diseases
among the British troops in India amounted in 1895 to
522 per thousand, “This does not mean that 522 men
per thousand were separately and individually admitted,
still less does it indicate that 522 soldiers per thousand
are incapacitated for duty from this cause. It
is calculated on the latest returns that an average
permanent reduction of 46 per thousand is the loss
entailed by these diseases.” In other words, instead of
over half being incapacitated from military duty, less
than one in twenty is off duty from this cause mentioned.
The larger number, which is calculated to startle the
public into submission to the demands of certain Anglo-Indian
officials, has been secured on the assumption that
every “admission” into hospital means a fresh case,
whereas it has been conceded that all re-admissions from
relapse, and every stage of the progress of disease which
requires a new diagnosis, has been reckoned as an
“admission.” A Member of Parliament who has been
enquiring about the hospital records, says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I have before me the hospital sheet of a man who was in
hospital from January 1st to January 25th in one year. During
that time the medical description of his disease was changed four
times, and the man is formally entered and discharged and
re-admitted on each of these occasions, the date of each discharge
and admission being entered in the column provided for the
purpose. So that this one man, who has been only once in
hospital during the year, actually furnishes four ‘admissions’ to
the official record. The same man was again in hospital from the
1st to the 30th of May, in the following year, during which time
the diagnosis being three times changed, he was entered as
admitted and discharged three times.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Statistics compiled on this basis are absolutely worthless
for the purposes of argument, and indicate, when so
used, a lack of conscience as to exact truthfulness. The
official figures of the Indian Army (included in the
Report of the Departmental Committee of 1897, strongly
advocating a return to licensed prostitution), lie before
us. It cannot be said that such a report would be likely
to minimize the amount of disease, yet this report, on
page 9, distinctly states: “In 1895 an average of 45 men
per thousand, or 3,200 in a force of 71,031 British soldiers
in India, were constantly in hospital for venereal diseases.”
Certainly this is sufficiently conclusive. The statement
is heralded to the world that all England is becoming
infected from the troops of diseased soldiers who return
yearly to the home-land. One advocate of licensed
prostitution in India says that “thirteen per cent.” of
the British soldiers are “annually invalided home
hopelessly incurable for military purposes.” But referring
to the same official statistics, embodied in the
Departmental Committee’s Report, we find that from
the year 1887 to the year 1895, 681 men out of the force
of 70,000 and more, were invalided home from these
diseases, or, on an average, 76 men annually out of the
whole force of 70,000; that is, <i>one-ninth of one per cent.</i>
Such unworthy attempts to frighten an unwilling
Christian public into acceding to the return to a system
of licensed prostitution, cannot be too strongly condemned.
Many well-meaning persons, on the assumption
that “figures will not lie,” are repeating these
exaggerated assertions, and will not take the trouble of
investigating for themselves. The Army Sanitary Commission
testified in 1894 that “a compulsory Lock Hospital
system in India has proved a failure.” There could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
be no higher authority to quote; and the attempt to
check diseases of this sort by the compulsory Lock Hospital
system had then been carried on for the good part of
a century in India. If the case could not be proved by
such a prolonged experiment, involving such injustice to
women, surely all honest people should be ready to
favour its abandonment.</p>

<p>But it is proposed now in certain quarters to examine
men as well as women. Two wrongs do not make a
right. Equality of degradation is not the sort of
equality for Christians to desire. Bring the test home.
Could the reader, without committing sin, go to a
physician to be examined in order to discover whether
he or she is “fit” to practise fornication? Then the
State that requires such an act becomes guilty in the
sight of God of committing the act. The guilt of that
which is done under actual compulsion rests wholly
upon the State or individual that thus enforces wrong-doing.
The one who advocates the compulsory examination
of women stands guilty before God as the
perpetrator of the outrage. It is a fearful thing when
the State becomes the perpetrator of such sin. We
know it is argued that the women and men subjected to
such regulations would be only those who are willing to
submit. We will dwell on that point a little further
on; at present it is enough to say, that because a thief
is willing to steal, the State is no less guilty that obliges
him to steal.</p>

<p>Certain women are, it seems, being deceived by the
pretence that laws are to be passed which will compel
men to attend the periodical examination. What is
the use of women clamouring for such a law as long as
<i>men enact and enforce all our laws</i>? Men will never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
legislate themselves into the degradations and inconveniences
of the compulsory periodical examination,
and go to reside in hospitals as long as they are afflicted
with disease. Will the Cantonment magistrate leave
his judicial bench to go and sit in the Lock Hospital
idly until he is no longer a source of danger to the
community? Will the colonel of a regiment leave his
soldiers to mutiny while he goes to reside in a Lock
Hospital for a term of weeks? Such talk is the merest
nonsense until only men of good morals control military
affairs, and if they did there would be small demand for
Lock Hospitals in India. The young soldiers could be
readily trained to decency were it not for the utterly
dishonouring views of life held by most of the high-titled
officials over them. On this very proposal to
examine men, the Secretary for War, Lord Lansdowne,
said in the House of Lords, in the debate that took
place May 17, 1897: “I have discussed that proposal
with many high authorities, and I am bound to tell
your lordships that the conclusion to which I am disposed
to arrive is that this practice of regular inspection
did not produce the desired effect; and that it was,
on the contrary, regarded, and rightly regarded, by
the men as a brutalizing and degrading practice.” It
has therefore been boldly determined and declared that
men shall not be subjected to periodical examination
(although there is not the faintest possibility of their
ever being subjected to this humiliation by physicians of
the opposite sex), for it is “brutalizing and degrading.”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>Yet it is these very men who are <i>directly</i> responsible
for bringing disease back to England; for the native
women do not go to England. The argument is, that
since it brutalizes and degrades men to cause them to
be examined, that they may not propagate disease in
England, therefore the native women of India must be
brutalized and degraded. It is useless to assert that
the practice will not degrade women; we know that
the moral nature of a woman is at least as susceptible
of being injured by enforced immodesty as that of a
man; in fact, as soon as it would serve any purpose in
making a point in the interest of self, these very men
would boldly proclaim, probably, the greater moral
susceptibility of woman. It seems the extreme of
servility for women to come to the front at this time,
and in the face of the utter repudiation of all intention
of examining men, declare for the examination of
women. When men will not yield their dignity one
jot, even for the sake of preserving the health of those
women of England who are to become their future
wives, what insolent hypocrisy for them to persuade
deluded women to help them to bring women under
practices so “degrading and brutalizing!” What infinite
capacity of servility in the nature of women who
will advocate such degrading, brutalizing treatment of
women!</p>

<p>But, we may be asked, Shall women show no concern
for the “innocent wives and children” of diseased men?
Again we ask, Which wives and which children—the
British or the Indian? There are hundreds of such wives
and children who have been forsaken by husbands and
fathers. There is almost a nation of Eurasians who curse
the day they were given an unwelcome existence. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
their mothers, in large numbers, were honestly married,
to their best belief and intention. Here are the <i>real</i>
wives and the <i>real</i> children in the sight of a just God,
and to them should England’s attention be first turned.
The chaklas hold many such unwilling prisoners, left
there by treacherous husbands and fathers. Some day
this wife of the officer or soldier will be turned out to
perish of the disease her system could no longer throw
off, and the children will either be retained as soldiers’
prostitutes or sent out to share the fate of the diseased
mother. The women of England are being besought
to turn their eyes on the future wives of British officers
and soldiers; it would be for England’s lasting good
would they but persistently keep their eyes on the
British officers’ and soldiers’ <i>present</i> wives and children
in the far-off East. Were attention more persistently
called to the Indian wife of the British soldier, there
would be much less likelihood of his finding opportunity
to entrap an innocent wife in the home-land.</p>

<p>It was suggested, in the first instance, by Sir George
White, successor to Lord Roberts as Commander-in-Chief
of the forces in India, and re-incorporated in the
despatch of the Secretary of State as to immediate
steps to be taken to check venereal disease, that
female medical assistants be employed to conduct the
examinations. It is our belief that respectable women-physicians
wish to treat disease—not prostitution. Even
if such were given the full control of Lock Hospitals,
which is not likely, we wonder how many would like to
return to their own country bearing certificates for
faithful service, such as Mahaldarni Ezergee of the Cantonment
of Rawal Pindi displayed to us with such
evident pride, that she had been trained in other besides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the ordinary duties of a mahaldarni: “The soldiers were
remarkably healthy while the prostitutes were under
her charge.” Again, another officer had testified: “Few
soldiers were in the hospital while the women were
under her care.” The surgeon of the regiment had
testified: “Disease has been reduced to a minimum
among the soldiers,” while the women were under
Ezergee, “superintendent of the prostitutes.” This is
what Lady Cook describes in a recent American
periodical as “ministrations to women,” while the
certificates show that everything that was done was
valued only as it protected the soldiers in vice; the
indications as to the health of the women are never
once even commented upon—all the work for women
was done <i>with reference to men</i>. This being the fact,
it is no wonder that in the official reply from India,
dated May 18, 1897, and signed by the Viceroy, Sir
George White, and others, it is declared that “It is
doubtful whether the women possessing the necessary
medical qualifications, and of a status sufficiently good
to preclude the possibility of their receiving bribes from
the women they have to examine, would be willing to
undertake the work.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>As regards the examination of the women, we take a
chapter out of the history of our India work, in illustration,
as recorded in our Journal:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="alignRight"><span style="margin-right: 1.0em;"><span class="smcap">Meerut</span>, India, February 8, 1892.</span></p>

<p>At half-past seven this morning we went down the Sudder
Bazaar to the neighbourhood of the Lock Hospital, it being
examination day. The building is well placed for observation,
being at a point where five streets meet, and several other streets
run close by. The hospital is a foreign bungalow with a verandah
in front, inclosed in a high brick wall. Already the girls, in gaudy
apparel and flashy jewelry, were assembling, and in a few moments
we counted thirty girls standing or sitting around, outside the
building and outside the gate in the street. They came walking
and riding in <i>ekkas</i> (native carts), and two loads came in cabs.
Some of them had several miles to come from the Rest Camp.
The vehicles waited for them across the street, under the shade
trees. The girls went in by twos or threes, as summoned. A tall
native policeman stood about, apparently to keep order. The
street was one of Meerut’s busiest thoroughfares. Men and boys
lounged here and there, and even tiny children looked on with
interest and curiosity. At one time we noticed not less than
twenty-five men and boys gathered about and discussing the scene.
A police station was close by, and an unusual number of men
lingered in front of it, discussing the women, as their glances and
manners indicated. One Eurasian woman brought a girl, evidently
held as a slave to make money for her; she seemed reluctant to
even trust her girl to go alone into the hospital, when her turn
came; and as soon as she emerged again, seized her and led her
away, the policemen shouting after her in derision, “Mem Sahib!
Mem Sahib!” (the name for “lady,” applied, as a rule, to white
women), to which the Eurasian gave no response.</p></blockquote>

<p>About a hundred women were examined that morning,
waiting their turn on the public street, while the crowd
gathered round to discuss the women kept by the
Government for British soldiers. No wonder the Commander-in-Chief
has decided that the female medical
assistants who could be induced to manage such an
affair would hardly be “sufficiently good to preclude the
possibility of their receiving bribes.” The Lock Hospitals
of the Orient, as we studied them in many
Cantonments of India, and also in Singapore and Hong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Kong, are for the treatment of prostitution rather than
for the treatment of disease, for the reason that only
those who could be quickly restored to health to go on
in their occupation are likely to be retained any length
of time for treatment. We have already referred to
the practice of turning cases of secondary, or advanced,
disease out of the Cantonment. The position at the
head of one of these hospitals is not likely to tax one’s
scientific resources much beyond instructing the native
women how to perform ablutions, so strongly urged by
Lord Roberts in his Circular Memorandum, in administering
douches, and in diagnosticating and keeping in
hospital all cases of catamenia. We do not marvel if
male surgeons have grown tired of the monotonous
round, and with a seeming burst of generosity propose
to give the position to medical women; particularly, if
by such “generous” expressions of appreciation for the
usefulness of women, they can lead over-credulous fine
ladies into the conclusion that at last all the objections
to the C.&nbsp;D. Acts have been met.</p>

<p>In spite of holding a degrading position the verdict of
the world is “A man’s a man for a’ that”; but not so
the woman who connects herself with an Eastern Lock
Hospital—her dignity would never sustain the shock.
Already the official conclusion is that no woman of intelligence
or honesty would accept such a position.
Women cannot afford to become the scavengers of the
profession. We remember interviewing an Englishwoman
in charge of a very large Lock Hospital in an
Eastern city; and after this we went directly to the
adjoining general hospital. We were welcomed by the
nurses and treated most cordially until we mentioned,
with design, the Englishwoman at the neighbouring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
hospital, and that we had been talking with her. A
frozen response abruptly ended further sociability, and
we learned thus that even underling nurses of other
hospitals held themselves as in a position to snub the
chief superintendent of a Lock Hospital in the East.</p>

<p>From the time that the abominable nature of the
Contagious Diseases Acts of England and India were
made known, and the Acts held up to public execration
and outlawed, like a condemned criminal, this System
has gone seeking a new <i>alias</i> that its identity might be
hidden from the inconvenience of exposure. Many times
these laws have been unmasked, and they have never
been able to survive the exposure of their real name,
which was at the first, “Contagious Diseases Acts.”</p>

<p>Over and over again has this criminal Law, when
caught sneaking about, denied his real name. Like a
fatal birthmark, which no power can eradicate, so this
abomination has its birthmark, which, when seen, fixes
the identity beyond all question. That birthmark is
<i>the compulsory examination of women</i>. This cannot be
made to serve the desired purpose without all the essential
features of the C.&nbsp;D. Acts. It makes not the
slightest difference whether the law is called the Health
Act, as in Australia, Getz’s <i>Projet de Loi</i>, as in Norway,
the Women’s and Girls’ Protection Ordinance, as at Singapore,
the Cantonment Acts or the Cantonments Act, or
what not—the test of the law, as to its identity with the
old infamous C.&nbsp;D. Acts, is, whether women are obliged
to submit to compulsory examination. “In fact, the
compulsory examination of women <i>is</i> the C.&nbsp;D. Acts.”
Let this one point be put into law, and all the rest goes
without saying. The battle has always raged around
this one central point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>To prove that the compulsory examination of women
necessitates the regulations that always attend it, let us
suppose that in a community this one point is provided
for by law, and that the officers of the law are left
to enforce the measure, by whatever regulations are
<span class="no-break">necessary:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The law demands merely that impure women must be examined
regularly for the protection of the public health.</p>

<p>But the police officer sees at once that to secure this point a
list must be kept of the women, when examined, that notice of
requirement can be sent to those not coming voluntarily. Thus
<i>registration</i> of prostitutes comes to pass.</p>

<p>But after examination, those found diseased must be placed by
themselves for treatment. Thus a hospital for prostitutes is
established.</p>

<p>Then provision must be made to compel those who are unwilling
to attend the examinations to do so, for it has been the invariable
experience that few women will go regularly for examination unless
compelled to do so, and also there must be means of enforcing
them to remain in hospital. Thus the hospital becomes a <i>Lock
Hospital</i>, and <i>fines and imprisonments</i> are imposed on delinquents.</p>

<p>But compulsion cannot be secured without the aid of the police
and the magistrate, and it is most difficult to follow up women,
prove their identity, hale them to examination and to Lock
Hospital without being able to keep them located in one tolerated
quarter or house where they may be found—hence <i>segregation</i> is
introduced; and this is also done to keep women with whom
association is supposed to be safe—because under constant medical
and police surveillance—separate from those with whom it is
supposed to be a risk to associate.</p>

<p>Now we discover that the compulsory periodical examination of
women of impure life, when carried out in actual operation, creates
a necessity for all the essential features of every C.&nbsp;D. Act that
has ever been known, namely: <i>Compulsory examination</i>; <i>Registration</i>;
<i>Lock Hospitals</i>; <i>Fines and Imprisonments</i>; <i>Police Surveillance</i>;
<i>Segregation</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yet another thing is needful for the operation of this
law requiring compulsory periodical examination,
namely, measures for extending the operation of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
law, so that, as new women are likely to become a
source of contamination, they also may be brought
under its operation, and for the practical and easy
operation of the measure, compelled to take up their
residence in segregated quarters. <i>This is the special
field of activity in the operation of the law</i>, and is a
deadly menace to the most ordinary liberties of women.
People will loudly advocate that “something must be
done” to confine the houses of ill-fame to certain
quarters of a city, without the slightest care as to how it
is done, so long as they need not become intimately
acquainted with a disagreeable subject; they will
advocate measures of the most deadly consequences to
others more defenceless than themselves, and to the
ultimate moral tone of the very society in which they
move, and yet heartlessly refuse to consider the responsibility
that rests upon them for their conduct.
“Something must be done,” they say, and the police
force must attend to the details; they are too loathsome
even to be considered, yet they refuse to understand
that these very loathsome details which they require
the police to work out <i>must utterly ruin the character of
the police</i> into whose hands they have betrayed all the
decent rights of womanhood.</p>

<p>What does it mean to women for men to assume the
right to arrest all suspicious characters and oblige them
to live in a certain house or street, and to appear at the
examinations at the Lock Hospitals? Let the banker
sitting in his bank, or the merchant in his shop, consider
what it would mean for him to be accosted in
his own place of business, taken off immediately to
the Lock Hospital, examined, and if the doctor so
ordered, sent immediately into exile in a hospital for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
libertines, with no chance to set his house in order or
to defend his character from the charge of being a
libertine! And even if the charge were true would he
not think the punishment too severe? And then, suppose
it were the case that, at the end of the imprisonment in
the hospital, he were required to reside for the rest of his
days in a certain street? This is <i>exactly</i> what is done
with women when once the principle is set up that compulsory
periodical examinations must take place. But
the reply is, No women of property or consequence
would ever be so treated. Very true; yet are not these
often utterly profligate? Certainly. So this is a law
which will be operated only in the case of the lowly.
Yes, it is a piece of legislation on the part of the mighty
to degrade and rob the daughters of the poor of their
most ordinary rights, and it deserves the <i>most extreme
execration</i> that human language is capable of, on that
very account. The day has passed by when it is safe to
try to enunciate such sentiments among a free people.
“What are the women making all this row about?” said
one of the daily journals of London, during our India
work; “no <i>high-born</i> ladies will ever be put to inconvenience
by such a law.” Ah! that was one of the
principal reasons why such a row was made.</p>

<p>What does it mean to arrest a suspected case and send
her to the segregated quarter for residence, where any
man can assume the right to insult her and demand
entrance at her door at any hour? It means that the
law takes hold of a woman who may have occasionally
done wrong and forces her to do wrong habitually; for
after segregation no one will give her honest work. That
law is radically wicked which confirms a human being into
a habitual breaker of one of God’s ten commandments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>And supposing the girl has not actually done wrong,
but has conducted herself imprudently, and brought just
suspicion on herself? To put her under the ban of such
a law means to create a prostitute by law. That law is
radically wrong which can be operated with such deadly
effect on society as to actually create evil. Yet everywhere
that the C.&nbsp;D. Acts have been operated such cases
have occurred. The mayor of a city in South Africa
told us that when a proposition for the introduction of
these regulations was being entertained by the City
Council of that place, and every effort was made to
secure his approval, he was one day accosted by an
alderman on the street, who plucked him by the sleeve,
and pointing out a perfectly respectable-looking woman
who was passing by, said, “Now, if we could get
our law we could get that woman.” He started back
in horror, thinking to himself, “And if he could get his
clutches on that woman by such a law, why not on any
woman?”</p>

<p>Policemen are not supposed to be infallibly virtuous;
and supposing they could be bribed or blackmailed? A
policeman in Queensland confessed that he had taken a
bribe to deliver a pretty girl over to the power of a
libertine by having her registered as a common prostitute,
and that he carried out the dastardly crime. A
Christian woman in Cape Colony heard of the arrest as
a common prostitute of a virtuous girl of her acquaintance,
and went to the court to secure her release.
There was a keeper of a house of ill-fame whom she
recognised, who came to make accusation against the
girl. The Christian worker appealed to a policeman,
whom she knew as a church-member and a man of good
repute, to stand with her for the girl’s defence; but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
evil woman took him to one side and she distinctly overheard
her threaten to blast his reputation if he interfered.
The magistrate took the word of this evil woman,
which was corroborated by the falsehoods of the policeman,
and in spite of her protestations, the girl was
registered.</p>

<p>Another case was told us by a Wesleyan minister’s
wife; it occurred in England, before the repeal of the
Acts. Her most intimate early friend, a lovely young
Christian girl, had a brother who quarrelled with a policeman
who threatened revenge. He watched his opportunity,
arrested the sister, and gave his oath that she was
a common prostitute; she was forced through the examination
and registered, and when at last found by her
brother, was a raving maniac as a result of the day’s
awful experience, and died shortly afterward in a madhouse.
We might multiply the instances we have ourselves
personally heard on good authority, and relate
some of the many cases known to the history of the
movement for repeal, but there is no space for further
enlargement.</p>

<p>Again we say there is something radically wrong with
this law, when women can be so fearfully wronged in its
operation, should the police officers and magistrates be
either wicked or weak. Practically such a law delivers
the reputation of women wholly over to the power of the
police. But, some one says, let no case be settled on
suspicion; let proof be brought. The question arises,
How secure the proof? In India it was considered
sufficient by Lord Roberts to teach the soldiers that it
was “a point of honour” to save other soldiers from
disease by informing against women; but it has frequently
been observed that the soldier will usually point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
out another woman rather than the one he has actually
associated with, and women are haled to the examinations
who may never have seen the informant before.
It detracts nothing from the peril of girls and women
when the uncorroborated testimony of a self-confessed
libertine can be used against them, and the frequency
with which evil men will combine to utterly break down
the testimony of a young woman in case of seduction,
and the unblushing testimony of these men to their own
shameful conduct, which is often treated as a joke by
the magistrate, shows that the reputation of a woman is
no safer in the hands of a combination of libertines.
Nothing is much more difficult than to actually <i>prove</i> a
woman a prostitute, and short of absolute proof, the
thought of registration, segregation, imprisonment in a
Lock Hospital, etc., is intolerable.</p>

<p>Again, a single act of fornication does not prove
prostitution, and how many acts shall constitute proof?
Practically, these are things that the law never has
considered at all; but wherever the compulsory examination
has been established, secret information from
libertines is received and acted upon with little question
as to its veracity, and the whole system has immediately
degenerated into a costly effort on the part of the State,
paid for by the taxes of respectable people, to pander to
the wishes of libertines, and keep the houses of ill-fame
filled with attractive and healthy inmates, and thus the
State becomes itself the great purveyor of vice. We
have said before repeatedly, and say again, that there is
no real evidence that prostitution has been made safer
by the periodical examination of women, because the
false security in vice greatly increases the amount of
vice, which is itself the cause of the diseases in question.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Not only does correct reason testify to this, but also
statistics uphold this statement.</p>

<p>We have now shown that the compulsory examination
of women brings into existence, of necessity, every
feature of what is commonly called the C.&nbsp;D. Acts; and
that, as that compulsory examination is of itself a sin,
so every feature of the enactments necessary to carry
out that law is at each step liable to fearful abuse, and
the system as a whole is ruinous to the morals of any
community.</p>

<p class="dropcap-m"><span class="smcap letter-spaced">Many</span> times in the course of our conversations
with the little women of India we had
promised before leaving them to do what
we could to secure relief and help for them.
In the simplicity of their faith and lack of
practical knowledge, several of them had
ventured to intimate that we might go to England and
see the Queen, and tell her their troubles. “For,” they
said, “the Queen does not countenance it; for she has
daughters of her own, and she cares for her daughters in
India.” “The Queen is a woman, and we also are
women, and our shame is the Queen’s shame; and for
us to be exposed is as though the Queen were exposed;
it is a shame for women to be so treated when a woman
is Queen.”</p>

<p>At Peshawar, at Lucknow, and at Meerut, the girls
had held us at parting until they had solemnly lifted
their eyes to heaven and asked God’s blessing on us,
and asked Him to help us to help them to get deliverance
from their oppression. God heard the prayer,
although their knowledge of Him was probably very
obscure. The sacred promises we gave them and gave
Him to help them, can never be set aside without bringing
guilt on our own souls. They depend upon us to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
voice their sorrows and plead their cause, by solemn
compact with them and God. May He keep us faithful
to the trust!</p>

<p>We carefully prepared the report of our investigations
and forwarded this to Miss Forsaith, of London, Secretary
of the British Committee of the Federation for the
Abolition of State Regulation of Vice. Then as the
summer was too far advanced to hold any meetings in
India, we proceeded to Australia, New Zealand, and
Tasmania, in the interests of our regular work. But in
the early part of the year 1893 we were summoned to
England to give evidence in person concerning the condition
of things in the Cantonments of India, which
went to prove that, although the C.&nbsp;D. Acts had been
ordered to be repealed, the same state of things was
being maintained, under the Cantonments Act of 1889,
and that the resolution of the House of Commons of
1888 had been disregarded.</p>

<p>A Departmental Committee was appointed by the
Government to receive our evidence. This Committee
was composed of Mr. George W. E. Russell, M.P.,
Under-Secretary of State for India (Chairman); The
late Right Hon. Sir James Stansfeld, M.P.; General
Sir Donald M. Stewart, Bart., G.C.B., Commander of the
Forces in India, before Lord Roberts; Sir James Peile,
K.C.S.I.; Mr. H. J. Wilson, M.P., with Major-General
O. R. Newmarch, C.S.I., as Secretary. The first sitting
of the Committee, at the India Office, London, was
April 11, 1893. Before this Departmental Committee
we appeared day after day until the full report of our
statements had been made. In the course of the giving
of this evidence, we described with accuracy the records
which we had seen in the various Lock Hospitals of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
ten Cantonments visited when in India, and a telegram
was sent by the chairman of the Committee, Mr. George
Russell, giving our description and requesting that these
records be impounded by the India Government and
forwarded to London for reference. Then our full statement
was despatched to India for reply.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lord Roberts, who had returned to England,
had been interviewed by a reporter of <i>The Christian
Commonwealth</i>, who placed before him some of our statements
regarding the Cantonments of India. Lord
Roberts pronounced them “simply untrue,” and declared
that he had recently made a tour of investigation through
the Cantonments, and knew that our statements were
false. His open charges of falsehood against us were
heralded throughout the Empire, and freely discussed
by the Press from the time they were made in April to
the time of our second appearance before the Committee
in August.</p>

<p>Upon the receipt of our evidence in India there was
a Special Commission appointed by the Indian Government,
to collect evidence in refutation of our charges,
two members of it being instructed to proceed to England
therewith, and to give personal testimony in behalf
of the Indian Government.</p>

<p>The Special Commission did not come before the
Committee until August, and we spent much of the
interim in addressing public meetings throughout Great
Britain, and arousing interest in the subject. Many
large and important meetings were also addressed by
such well-known leaders as Mrs. Josephine Butler, the late
Sir James Stansfeld, M.P., Mr. Henry J. Wilson, M.P.,
and Mrs. H. J. Wilson, Mr. James Stuart, M.P., and
many other Members of Parliament. At the annual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
conferences and assemblies of the various denominations,
the subject was taken up; many ladies of the Women’s
Liberal Federation and of the British Women’s Temperance
Association, and of other bodies, presented the
matter in their meetings, and ministers of all denominations
lent their help. At all these meetings resolutions
were passed condemning legalized vice, and from
all of them memorials were sent to the Government,
protesting against the condition of things prevalent in
the Cantonments of India. It was truly touching to
witness the intense interest manifested in the subject by
the common people, the class from whom the soldiers
are so largely drawn, and for whose sake military
officials claimed that it was necessary to establish the
chakla system. The mothers and fathers of British lads
had their own opinion as to what was necessary for their
boys.</p>

<p>“I’ll buy him off! I’ll buy him off!” exclaimed one
woman to us, with streaming eyes, at the close of one of
our meetings. “My boy enlisted to go to India without
my consent and then repented, and I thought it would
teach him a lesson to compel him to abide by his word.
He has already got as far as Gibraltar, I think; but I’ll
send the money and buy him off. I cannot consent to
let him go out under officers who will teach him that
vice is necessary.” Another mother expressed great
indignation at our statements regarding the temptations
put in the way of young soldiers by their superiors, and
declared she would write to her boy and obtain his
contradiction of them. The reply came back, and the
almost broken-hearted mother caused it to be conveyed
to us, together with an exhortation that we should “cry
aloud and spare not.” It was to the following effect:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, mother, all those ladies say is true, and much
more that they do not know, and you would hardly
believe. I have been so harassed and persecuted that
sometimes I have gone to the chakla, pretending to sin,
but God knows I have not; it was the only way to
escape their merciless persecution.”</p>

<p>We have been informed many times that there were
military officers who sneered at virtuous soldiers as
lacking proper fighting qualities, and who deliberately
fostered in their soldiers animal propensities, for the
sake of the ferocity of disposition that attends licentiousness.</p>

<p>The names of the special Commissioners were:
Mr. Denzil Ibbetson and Surgeon-Colonel J. Cleghorn,
M.D., Inspector-General of Civil Hospitals throughout
the Punjab. In addition to these witnesses from India
and ourselves, Lord Roberts, Quartermaster-General
Chapman, and Mr. Hyslop Bell, of Darlington, were
called before the Departmental Committee to give
evidence.</p>

<p>The statements of Lord Roberts and of General
Chapman, who were called before the Departmental
Committee in August, proved to be matters of intense
interest, especially as regarded their disagreement as to
Lord Roberts’ knowledge of the Infamous Memorandum.
Lord Roberts testified that, when the Resolution
of 1888 was carried in the House of Commons
not permitting the compulsory examination of women
or the licensing of prostitution, he understood those
measures to mean <i>abolition</i>, not modification, of
measures for the regulation of prostitution, and proceeded
accordingly. The Resolution meant the abolishing
of the periodical examination, of licensing, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
compulsion, of regulation, etc. He declared that he
knew nothing of the Infamous Memorandum which had
been issued in his name, and that he “entirely disapproved”
of some of the contents of that circular, saying,
“I certainly would not have approved of that part of the
Circular which referred to providing them with pretty
young women.” Lord Roberts was confronted with a
mass of evidence which he little expected. After his
own sweeping contradictions of our statements, he
was shown the report from the Cantonment of Meean
Meer which the Special Commission had brought from
India, and in which nearly every statement we had made
was “admitted.” Other <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the truth
of our statements convinced him that our testimony was
not to be broken down. As he left the Committee it
was with the conviction that General Chapman was
next to be called, and would give most disagreeable
evidence against him as regarded the Infamous Memorandum
and its authorship. Lord Roberts proceeded
immediately to Scotland, and from thence wrote the
following letter of <span class="no-break">apology:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="alignRight"><span style="margin-right: 1.0em;"><span class="smcap">Dunbar</span>, Scotland, 11 August, 1893.</span></p>

<p>Having read the reports of Mr. Ibbetson’s Committee, in regard
to the working of the Rules dealing with the abolition of Lock
Hospitals, etc., in Cantonments in India, and also the reports of
the officers commanding the seven stations which the Committee
did not visit, I frankly admit that the statements of the two
American missionary ladies, who made a tour through Upper
India in the cold weather of 1891–92, for the purpose of inquiring
into the matter, are in the main correct.</p>

<p>I hoped and believed that the orders issued to give effect to the
Resolution of the House of Commons had been everywhere
obeyed. In some stations the Rules have been strictly enforced,
but in others it now turns out this has not been completely the
case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>I deeply regret this, and I feel that an apology is due from me
to the ladies concerned. This apology I offer unreservedly.</p>

<p>In doing so, I would remark that I think it would have been
better if the missionary ladies had been commended to the care of
the authorities in India. We could have assisted them to carry
out the work on which they were engaged; omissions and shortcomings
would have been remedied at the time; a great deal of
unpleasantness would have been avoided; the ladies themselves
would have found their task considerably lightened; and there
would have been less chance of their drawing wrong deductions
from some of the circumstances which came under their notice, as
in sundry instances they would seem from Mr. Ibbetson’s Committee
Report to have done. This was owing, no doubt, to a want
of knowledge of the language, and of the habits and customs of
the people of India.</p>

<p class="alignRight"><span style="margin-right: 3.0em;" class="smcap">Roberts.</span></p>

</blockquote>

<p>This letter was accompanied by a short note to the
Chairman requesting him to annex the letter of apology
to the official report of the proceedings of the Committee.</p>

<p>A few days later General Chapman came before the
Committee and testified with regard to the Circular
Memorandum: “It was prepared at Simla, after the
Commander-in-Chief [Lord Roberts] had completed his
annual inspection, and had freely discussed with the
officers in command the various measures which it was
proposed to adopt.” General Chapman described the
manner in which it was done as follows: The Commander-in-Chief
gave the instruction that the Circular be
prepared; then it was drawn up by officials in the
General’s office under his supervision. The Surgeon-General
was consulted; then the Circular was issued
under the authority of the Commander-in-Chief. It was
sent first to the Military Department of the Government
of India, and then sent in every direction to all the
authorities in India. He said he “could not have
issued” the Circular “unless Lord Roberts had seen it;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
that would have been perfectly impossible.” When
questioned particularly as to Lord Roberts’ knowledge
of that part of the document which, as Lord Roberts
expressed it, called for “pretty young women” to be
provided for the soldiers, General Chapman said of these
sentences: “He certainly did approve of them.” When
asked how it was that the Secretary of State laid the
blame on him (General Chapman), in the House of
Commons, he replied: “Sir John Gorst said it was
necessary to put the blame on somebody, therefore he
put it on me.”</p>

<p>In the meantime a box had arrived from India containing
the hospital records, which had been impounded
by the Indian Government, on the request of the
Chairman of the Committee, and they furnished a large
quantity of <i>prima facie</i> evidence, in the very handwriting
of the British officials. These books being placed in
our hands, we were able to verify the statements we had
given in evidence concerning these records, and were
also able to place official documents before the Committee
which disproved some of the statements which
had been conveyed to England from India by the hand
of the two Special Commissioners. As this well
illustrates the utter unreliability of many Anglo-Indian
official assertions, we will copy a condensed and simplified
extract from the proceedings of that session of the
Committee at which we placed official document against
official document, and pointed out irreconcilable differences.</p>

<p>The reader must try to imagine us sitting in one of
the spacious rooms of the India Office. At the head of
an oval polished table sat Mr. Russell, the chairman;
to his left sat General Newmarch, Sir Donald Stewart,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and Sir James Peile. To the chairman’s right sat the late
Sir James Stansfeld, whose prerogative it was to conduct
the examination; next to him were Mr. Casserley, Q.C.,
counsel for our side, and Henry J. Wilson, M.P. At the
opposite end of the table from the chairman sat the
stenographer and ourselves. It is to be understood that
Mr. Stansfeld asks the questions and we answer:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Question</i>—We will pass to the book of requisition for tickets.
[This was a book from which many leaves were torn, leaving
counterfoils on which were memoranda signifying that the
extracted leaves were given to the Cantonment Magistrate, calling
for tickets for women, who were thereby certified as under the
charge of the physician, and licensed to practise prostitution.]</p>

<p><i>Answer</i>—I have it.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—And you can number the counterfoils; how many requisitions
to the Cantonment Magistrate for licensed tickets does it say on
the 1st of May, 1892?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Twenty-one.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Does it say on counterfoils of tickets in respect of the
nineteen new requisitions on 15th June, 1892?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—It does.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Therefore that is evidence that the issue of tickets at any
rate endured longer than May?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Yes, longer than the 1st of May; it shows that it continued
until the 15th of June, 1892.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—At any rate, on the 15th of June a requisition was made for
nineteen tickets?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Nineteen tickets.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—According to the Military Reports before us, page 18, on
line 940: “Women were registered, tickets issued, and bi-monthly
inspections made between March, 1890, and May, 1892; it was
brought to my notice in May, 1892 that tickets were being issued
to prostitutes in Meean Meer; I ordered the discontinuance of the
practice at once, and it was reported to me on the 17th of May,
1892, that no registration of prostitutes in any form whatever then
continued;” and it appears from what you have now produced,
that at any rate requisitions were made as late as the 15th of June;
that is so, is it not?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Yes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Q.</i>—Of those requisitions on that date, the 15th of June, as well
as on several other dates, do you find some, and how many, issued
for the Royal Artillery Bazaar?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—I counted twenty that were for the Royal Artillery Bazaar
women.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Have you seen the Report of the Commanding Officer for
the regiment dated 19th June, 1893, and does it state that no
tickets had been issued for the regiment since February, 1891?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Yes, I saw that statement; it is page 2 of the supplementary
sheet, line 95, under Meean Meer. The statement of Captain Goff,
commanding the Royal Artillery. That note says, “No registration
of prostitutes or issue of tickets in any form whatever has ever
been carried out by the Royal Artillery since the present battery
came to the station, February, 1891.”</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—What you find is that twenty tickets were issued?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—It is since February, 1891, according to this book some
twenty tickets have been issued for the Royal Artillery.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Up to what date?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Up to June 15th, 1892.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—You produce a ticket here which you obtained from one of
the women; what was the date of that ticket; was not the date of
the year 1892?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—It was dated 1892; that we procured at the Artillery
Bazaar.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Did I understand you to say that you found twenty tickets
were issued to the women of the Artillery?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Yes, twenty counterfoils left are of the Royal Artillery.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Stansfeld to the Committee</i>—That fact, which is testified to
by the counterfoils of this book, is inconsistent with the statement
of the Commanding Officer in his Report.</p></blockquote>

<p>These are but a few of the many instances in which
the official records sent to London for inspection, contradicted
the testimony of military officers.</p>

<p>The first sitting of the Departmental Committee was
April 11, its last sitting August 15, and its report was
circulated in Parliament September 11, 1893.</p>

<p>With the acknowledgment from the Commander-in-Chief
of the truth of our statements, a most sweeping
victory had been gained for the cause; no under-official
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
could very well dispute the word of the Commander-in-Chief
of the army. Lord Roberts’ remark that “the
ladies themselves would have found their task considerably
lightened” had they been “commended to the care
of the authorities in India,” was the source of a good
deal of amusement on the part of our friends, and led to
many a sarcastic comment on the part of the public
press; some of which ran somewhat as follows: “As
Lord Roberts freely admitted that he did not know
these things, certainly had the ladies appealed to him
they need not have come back so loaded with information;
this would have greatly lightened their task.” “As
there was a regulation which allowed any suspicious
characters to be expelled from the Cantonments without
assigning a reason therefor, the application of this
regulation would greatly have ‘lightened their task,’”
etc., etc.</p>

<p>What had been fully established by the evidence
cannot be better expressed than in the recent utterance
of the British Committee for the Abolition of State
Regulation of Vice, <span class="no-break"><i>i.e.</i>:—</span></p>

<p>“The fact was fully established that the so-called
voluntary system had been completely overridden by
<i>extra-legal</i> practices, of which the provision placing, or
interpreted to have placed, venereal diseases under the
same rule as ‘cholera, small-pox, diphtheria, or typhoid
fever,’ became the fulcrum or pivot.” The thing which
now remained to be done was to embody the Resolution
of the House of Commons of 1888 in a law which must
be passed by the Government of India, that could not be
longer evaded or disobeyed. After much discussion and
consideration, the Secretary of State for India directed
that the Cantonment regulations which related to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
removal to hospital of those persons suspected of contagious
or infectious diseases, must be so altered as to
admit of the treatment of contagious diseases due to
vice in a manner that would not be liable to abuse of or
injury to the reputation of women.</p>

<p>Accordingly the Cantonments Act of 1889 in so far
as it provided for the compulsory examination of
women suspected of contagious diseases due to vice,
and their forcible detention in hospital under penalty of
expulsion from the Cantonment, was altered to apply
only to cholera, smallpox, diphtheria, or typhoid fever.
This was done to protect the character and reputation
of women, for it had been conceded on all sides that
hitherto the only method practicable for getting hold of
suspected women was on the information of male
libertines, and that such persons when questioned as to
the source of their contagion, generally sought to cover
their own wrong-doing or protect their real partner in
sin by accusing some other woman, often a perfectly
innocent person.</p>

<p>This new Act, called the Cantonments Act Amendment
Act, was passed on February 8, 1895. The point
which was gained by the passage of this new Act was
one of great importance, namely, that there were moral
and social questions involved in the treatment of contagious
diseases due to vice which could not be overlooked
in the medical management of such disorders
without serious consequences. It was, in the nature of
the case, impossible to place these diseases on the same
footing as other contagious disorders. The reasons for
this position have been recently expressed very concisely
and forcibly by the British Committee, in the following
<span class="no-break">language:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“1. It casts no stigma on the name or character of a person to
assert that he, or she, is affected with ‘cholera, smallpox, diphtheria,
or typhoid fever,’ and it can be ascertained whether such statement
be true without shock to the feelings of the most refined. The
opposite is the case with venereal disease, in regard to which
a mis-statement is a virtual libel, and a compulsory examination is
an indecent outrage. 2. As regards the former classes of disease,
no conceivable measures can have any moral bearing; whereas in
the latter class compulsory (and in some of its relations, even
voluntary) submission to examination or treatment has the gravest
moral consequences both to the individual and to the community.
3. The procedure under the rules you propose is as follows:
The medical officer is informed by a soldier that a certain woman
is diseased. Believing that, he orders her for examination at the
hospital. She may be perfectly honourable or perfectly healthy.
In either case if she refuses to attend she is held to be diseased
and is expelled from the Cantonment. We submit that the whole
of this procedure, though it may be in words the same as in a case
of cholera, is in fact utterly different in the means by which
information is secured, in the nature of the evidence as to fact, and
in the consequences to the woman who disputes the fact. The
operation of the rules, so far as venereal disease is concerned, is
not general.</p>

<p>“In the Report of the Special Indian Commission appointed in
1893 by the Government of India to inquire into the working of
the regulations, it is stated that so far as venereal disease is
concerned the operation of the rules is ‘practically confined by
sheer force of circumstances to women.’ … ‘Even with
regard to them information is difficult to obtain, for a man often
does not know, and still oftener will not tell, which woman has
diseased him.’ … ‘Except in the not infrequent cases where
a woman herself applies for medical aid, this (<i>i.e.</i>, information
necessary to proceed upon) can only be obtained from men who
have been diseased by them.’ It is clear, then, that a man, as the
result of an admittedly immoral act, becomes an informer, and in
many cases a false informer, upon whose testimony the State has
to rely for submitting the woman to the most degrading process.
We submit that there is no parallel between venereal disease and
cholera, either in the procedure here indicated, or in the effect of
that procedure on moral conduct, or in the position in which it
places the State.”</p></blockquote>

</div>
<p class="dropcap-w"><span class="smcap letter-spaced">We</span> have referred to the discrepancies between
the statements of Lord Roberts and of
General Chapman; between Lord Roberts’
first attempt to discredit our evidence and
subsequent admission of its truth; between
the records that had been kept at the Lock Hospitals
which we visited in India and the statements sent home
by the Special Commission. All these things must tend
to weaken the faith of the public in Anglo-Indian
representations. They all accord in spirit with the gross
exaggerations which have been put forth, as though a
veritable scourge of such diseases was at the door of
England. As to the prevalence of disease, “Between
fifty and sixty per cent. of our Indian army,” is found to
be, in actual fact, only <i>four and one-half per cent.</i> (see
page 69), and “Thirteen per cent. annually invalided
home hopelessly incurable,” is found to be, in actual fact,
only <i>one-ninth of one per cent.</i></p>

<p>“Our power is being sapped—our race defiled—and
we are forced to ask ourselves if no means can be devised
of stopping so gigantic an infliction.” What does this
mean in exact figures? How “gigantic” in reality is
this infliction? The official figures of the very document
which was meant to originate the alarm, the Report
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of the Departmental Committee of 1897 shall testify.
The latest year reported in this document is 1895, and
as the law which effectually forbade the compulsory examination
of women was passed on February 8, 1895,
the figures show the result only of <i>less than eleven
months</i> covering the existence of that law. Out of a
force of 71,031 soldiers in India nineteen more men
were sent home to England, “hopelessly incurable” from
vice, in 1895 than in the year 1894. <i>Nineteen cases</i>
represent the size of this “gigantic infliction” which
has been made the occasion of raising such a cry of
alarm, and a demand for the return to licensed prostitution
and the re-enslavement of thousands of native
women by compulsory examination measures.</p>

<p>In the year 1894, 111 men were sent home invalided
from this cause, and in 1895, 130 men were sent home—an
increase of nineteen cases. We do not wish to minimize
the evil of even these few cases; but is a decent
nation prepared to hazard an attempt to purchase immunity
from disease by plunging into brazen defiance of
God’s seventh commandment? What about the “gigantic
[immoral] infliction” of the atheistic assumption that
chastity is a sanitary failure, and fornication a necessity?
There is no comparison between the “gigantic infliction”
upon England of a teaching to defy God’s commandments
in the fancied interests of physical health, and
the presence of nineteen additional diseased soldiers in a
population of thirty-five millions.</p>

<p>But if we continue the study of the table of statistics
found on page 9 of the Report referred to, we find that
eighty-four more men were sent home to England in
1894 for diseases due to vice, than during the previous
year, 1893. If the increase of disease in 1895 over 1894
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
is to be attributed to the Amendment Act of 1895, to
what shall we attribute the much more pronounced
increase of 1894 over 1893? Again, there were forty
more men sent home invalided in 1891 than in 1890;
and forty-three more sent home in 1888 than in 1887,
and none of these years were under the Amendment Act
of 1895. Therefore it is proved that variations and increases
have taken place that have had nothing to do
with the Amendment Act of 1895, which, when it serves
the object of advocates of licensed vice, is held wholly
responsible for the insignificant variation of an increase
of nineteen cases. In view of these facts, we must declare
our solemn conviction that the agitation for a return
to legalized prostitution in India is not due to any feeling
of alarm on account of the spread of contagion in the case
of the <i>originators</i> of the agitation, but that an attempt is
being made to frighten an unwilling Christian public into
a reluctant consent to return to a system which regards
the whoremonger as a necessity, the commandments of
God a farce, and the slave trade in women an important
part of the business of the State.</p>

<p>Life in India does not tend to the elevation of British
morals, and this not because of the climate, as some contend.
The industrial conditions are all against good
morals, and are closely analogous to the conditions
that prevailed in the Southern States of America before
the Civil War. Wages are so low in India as to constitute
the native the virtual slave of the Anglo-Saxon.
By means of the pitiful wages paid for work, not one-half
the comfort is provided by white masters to Indian
servants that was secured to the black men in America,
by the few of those owners of slaves who were really
humane. The very fact that the slave was a rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
scarce article and a good price paid for him in
America, made it to the interest of his owner to look
after his health and comfort to a certain extent. We
are not defending slavery—it is an abomination in the
sight of God, whether it exists under the disguise of
abnormally low wages or shows itself openly; and
slavery is always a greater moral curse to the master
than to the oppressed. England virtually owns a whole
nation of slaves in her control of India, and the effect of
this fact upon the morals of that country will depend
wholly upon whether she rules to redeem her subjects or
to enrich herself. The worst feature of all in slavery is
the appropriation of women by their masters. And this
form of villainy is always excusing itself by slandering
the oppressed women.</p>

<p>“This life is not <i>a life of shame</i> in the sense in which
this is true in England. Most of these women are
prostitutes by caste and <i>can feel no desire to give it up</i>,”
says the Report of the Special Commission of 1893.
“They are accepted as safeguards to society, and are
not themselves ashamed of their calling,” says a high
military officer. “They feel no shame about this; they
are never recruited from seduced girls, as in England,”
says another of these high and mighty officers, who
know so much better how these girls feel and what they
desire than do the poor slaves themselves. To be sure,
they sob and cry and petition for deliverance, and
protest their outraged feelings against the examinations;
but that merely proves what hypocrites they are,
and how cleverly they can play a part. “They are as
artful as a waggon-load of monkeys,” said one Anglo-Indian
to us; the “most vicious and degraded of the
population,” says another. And yet they are, many of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
them, the offspring of British men. One would imagine
them gray-haired in the service of Satan, from these
accounts, and yet General Viscount Frankfort states in
the Report of the Special Commission of 1893: “It is
roughly estimated that 50 per cent. [of the girls of the
chakla] are of the age of fourteen to sixteen or so;”
and in reply to our evidence as to some of the girls
being as young as “from fifteen to sixteen years of age,”
Major General Sir W. Elles, K.C.B., replies, “The
probability is that prostitution is practised at even
younger ages than this.” In reply to our further
statement that many girls are kept at the point of
starvation, are always in debt, and cannot escape on
this account, even if otherwise the way might be open,
Colonel T. G. Crawley, commanding Allahabad District,
makes the following calculation (page 360, Departmental
Committee Report of <span class="no-break">1893):—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It stands to reason that the women could not be in debt, for
if a woman only received six men daily for twenty-three days in a
month, at the rate of only four annas [about fourpence] per visit,
that would represent thirty-four rupees eight annas, and even
allowing one-fourth of this to go to the mahaldarni, rent two
rupees, and food at the rate of four annas daily for thirty days, a
woman would have fully seventeen rupees [a little more than one
pound] a month clear.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This for the health of British soldiers and their
“future wives” and “unborn offspring” in England!
and fifty per cent. of these victims from fourteen to
sixteen years of age! And will women physicians be
induced to attempt the task of keeping these mere
children in health under such conditions?</p>

<p>Anglo-Indian sentiment would not long content
itself with the loss of its highly prized C.&nbsp;D. Acts. The
military officials had professed to abrogate them when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
they hid them away under the cloak of the Indian
Cantonment Acts, and then again when they hid them
under the cloak of the Cantonments Act of 1889; but
they were at last fairly caught by the Cantonments Act
Amendment Act of 1895, which tore away from them
the pretence of “only treating this as any other
contagious disease.”</p>

<p>Regulation had been in operation in India, in one
form or another, for the largest part of a century, and
statistics show a steady increase of disease, with slight
variations, during all that time. And the Army
Sanitary Commission, the highest British medical
authority, had in 1894 pronounced this prolonged
experiment with licensed vice a failure, in the following
unequivocal <span class="no-break">language:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The facts, so far as we can ascertain them, lead us to the
conclusion that a compulsory Lock Hospital system in India has
proved a failure, and that its re-institution cannot consequently be
advocated on sanitary grounds. In stating this conclusion, we
may add that we are merely repeating the opinions which the
Army Sanitary Commission have uniformly held, that venereal
diseases in the army of India could not be repressed by such
restrictive measures, and in support of this statement, we may refer
to the Memoranda on the Indian Sanitary Reports which have
issued from this office for many years.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Yet a Departmental Committee was secured in
November, 1896, by Anglo-Indian influence brought to
bear upon the Government, to examine into the matter
and report on the prevalence of diseases due to vice;
and it reported, as was expected, in favour of a return
to the system of legalized vice. The Departmental Committee
reported at the beginning of the year 1897, on
statistics no later than the year 1895. Now the Cantonments
Act Amendment Act became a law in India,
February 8, 1895, and how much time elapsed before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
this Amendment Act came into <i>practical operation</i>
remains yet to be shown; yet an attempt is made to
show that incalculable mischief has been done during
these eleven months of the actual existence of the
law which abolished licensed prostitution. The official
statistics of which they make use do not at all justify
the calculations and conclusions they have drawn
therefrom.</p>

<p>At about the time of the report of the Departmental
Committee, there was formed in England an association
with the object of securing the re-establishment of
legalized vice in India. The names of high British
military officials make up its membership list, in large
part. The association printed a pamphlet, based upon
the Departmental Committee’s Report in favour of a
return to the old conditions, a Report that was calculated
to frighten the public, if possible, into acceding to
their demands, on the supposition that a fearful scourge
was upon them, and that no time was to be lost in getting
it under check. Then Lord George Hamilton, on
March 26, 1897, sent a dispatch to the Government of
India, calling attention to the Report of the Departmental
Committee, and ordering stricter measures for
the suppression of diseases due to vice, but adding:
“There must be no provision of women, … no
registration, … no compulsory examination of
women,” etc., but urging that it was “imperatively
necessary that this disease should not be exempted from
the measures adopted to prevent the spread of other
contagious diseases.” “If there be any compulsion, it
is precisely of the same kind as that which has been
accepted as necessary and enforced without any objection
in the case of diphtheria or typhoid fever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the first quotation given effectually contradicts
the second, at the point of the compulsory examination
of women; and such instructions were, in fact, a virtual
order to repeal the Amendment Act of 1895, very
covertly expressed, and so it was recognised immediately
by the British Committee for the Abolition of State
Regulated Vice, which promptly issued a memorial on
the subject addressed to Lord George Hamilton,
Secretary of State for India.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>On April 21, 1897, there appeared in the London
<i>Times</i> part of a letter from Lady Henry Somerset to
Lord George Hamilton, in which she “expresses gratification
at finding incorporated in a document of such
importance a statement of inspiring and controlling
principles.” She notes with satisfaction the “inclusion
of this disease among other contagious diseases,” as the
“only rational and scientific principle on which its eradication
can be attempted.” “It is not however, proposed
to carry out this principle to its full logical result; and
herein lies the point on which she finds herself at issue
with Lord George Hamilton.” At the end of the letter
is affixed the system of legislation best suited to the end,
in the opinion of Lady Henry Somerset, and it will be
seen at a glance that her propositions would indeed
carry out the principle to its full, logical end. A special
importance attaches itself to these propositions, because
of the strategic position held by Lady Henry Somerset
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>as president of the British Women’s Temperance Association
of England, and first vice-president of the World’s
W.C.T.U., and her action put her in absolute opposition
to the purity department of both those societies.</p>

<p>The scheme proposed by Lady Henry Somerset is here
given in her own words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“1. A quarter of each Cantonment should be reserved for such
women as are permitted to remain in camp, and all such women
should be compelled to remain in houses or rooms specifically
reserved to each by a registered number. The admission of men
to this quarter should be strictly supervised.</p>

<p>“2. No woman should be allowed to remain in this quarter
unless periodically examined by properly qualified women doctors.</p>

<p>“3. No soldier should be allowed to enter this quarter without
having undergone a like examination and having the same report.</p>

<p>“4. A register should be kept recording the name of each
soldier entering the quarter, the number of the house to which he
goes, and the date of such entry.</p>

<p>“5. On any woman being found to be diseased in this quarter,
or on any soldier found to be suffering in like manner, all such
persons that the registered visits show to have rendered themselves
liable to contagion should be put in quarantine until such time as
their immunity can be verified.</p>

<p>“6. All consorting with women outside this quarter should
render the offender liable to severe penalty.”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The <i>Shield</i>, official organ of the British Committee for
the Abolition of State Regulated Vice, in its issue of
May, 1897, comments as follows upon this scheme:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The suggestions above quoted embody the most complete
State Regulation of prostitution which we have ever seen
described, in its baldest and most absolute form, and imply the
most complete identification of the State with the purely animal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>side of the matter which has ever been proposed. They seem to
emanate from a mind influenced for the time solely by the idea of
equality between man and woman, to the exclusion of other
considerations. Such proposals seem indeed to make the sexes
equal, but it is an equality of unspeakable degradation for both.”</p></blockquote>

<p>On May 14 and 17 occurred a debate in the House of
Lords on the question of a return to legalized prostitution
in India, in which reference was made to Lady
Henry Somerset’s letter in <i>The Times</i>, and to another
memorial which was shortly “to be made public,” and
which was signed by a very large number of ladies, as
an indication that women were no longer, as formerly,
opposed to the system of State Regulation of Vice.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>On May 25 <i>The Times</i> published the text of this
Memorial, which is signed by ladies of the aristocracy,
together with a few other prominent women, numbering
in all one hundred and twenty-three.</p>

<p>The Government of India proceeded at once to repeal
the Cantonments Act Amendment Act of 1895, in the
Viceregal Council held at Simla July 8, which action
had received the approval of Lord George Hamilton by
telegram, July 6, 1897. Since that day, therefore, the
military authorities have been set free to return to the
establishment of brothel slavery, the registration and
compulsory examination of women, the employment of
procuresses, and all the infamies which we have described
as existing when we visited India in 1892.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the women of Great Britain have arisen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>in mighty protest, and a Memorial signed by 61,437
women of the United Kingdom, addressed to Lord
George Hamilton, as representative of Her Majesty’s
Government, was presented at the India Office on
Saturday, July 31, 1897, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It declares the unaltered and unalterable hostility of the
signatories to every form of State Regulation of Immorality,
whether embodied in the system which was known as the Contagious
Diseases Acts or in any other form, including the slightly
modified and more subtle garb of certain Indian Cantonment
rules.</p>

<p>“It objects to the principle of all such legislation, a principle
based on the assumption of the necessity of vice. It opposes the
system in all its forms, because it inevitably becomes, in regard to
women, an engine of the most shameful oppression, removing the
guarantees of personal liberty which the law has established, and
putting their reputation, their freedom, and their persons absolutely
in the power of the police; while in respect to those women who
come immediately under its action, it cruelly violates the feelings
of those whose sense of shame is not wholly lost, and further
brutalizes even the most abandoned.</p>

<p>“The Memorialists, while deploring the existence of disease
and favourable to moral methods of diminishing it, urge that no
permanent diminution of disease will ever be attained by measures
which do not strike primarily at the vice itself, and express the
hope that the Government of our country will be withheld from
the crime of ever again entering into any compact with evil by
its attempted regulation.”</p></blockquote>

<p>We have been deeply impressed with the thought
that, in our search for the cause of the present moral
confusion, we need to go further back than the influence
of high-placed military officers and ladies of the aristocracy.
There have arisen occasions in the past when
the Christian public have been able to successfully
resist the invasions of materialistic and immoral counsels,
although they were advocated by the rich and
mighty. Only the blind can be led by the blind: those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
who have clear vision will not follow such leadership.
Whence this far-reaching influence, then, which has
blinded the eyes of so many? Alas! these are the
days of a paralysed faith, and faith is as indispensable a
faculty of the human mind as is reason.</p>

<p>The re-enthronement of faith is the need of the hour.
Science we have, and scholarship: but hesitancy and
doubt rule the scientific spirit, and timidity is the vice of
the scholar. The soldier who hesitates and doubts and
grows timid will not win a single battle. His must be
the prophetic spirit of faith which “laughs at impossibilities,
and cries, It shall be done.” But the Church
militant has been ridiculed out of the warrior spirit, and
has laid aside its mightiest weapon, faith; and as to
leadership, many are pointing to science and scholarship
and crying, “These be thy gods, O Israel!”
Science and scholarship have their place and their
power, but they are not the Christian’s mightiest
weapons. Learning cannot take the place of the inspiration
of faith; statistics can never teach morals as
forcibly as “Thus saith the Lord.” More than this:
statistics can never overturn the “Thou shalt not” of an
Almighty God.</p>

<p>David has essayed to go forth to meet Goliath, well
loaded down with Saul’s armour, and David will meet
with the defeat he deserves if he does not repent of the
folly of matching such weapons against one who defies
the armies of the living God. The warfare is a spiritual
not a carnal one. What wonder that with such weapons
courage has failed, the citadel is imperilled, and
“counsels of despair” are urged. But these shall not
prevail. That unrepentant soul shall not go unpunished
by the wrath of a just God, who enters into complicity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
with the vice of fornication by consenting to the
proposal for its State management.</p>

<p>But can this vice ever be actually exterminated?
Probably never entirely by human law; but neither can
stealing, so far as we are able to judge. The vice of
stealing is likely to continue so long as the city of London
exists, in spite of the most excellent human laws.
Shall we then license stealing? No one who has a purse
to be protected would advocate such rash legislation.</p>

<p>A conclusive answer to the plea of “a necessary evil”
has been already given by our Judge. Looking upon
the vices of those about Him, and the inevitable crop of
increasing vice, with its attendant misery, to which his
people were tending, He cried: “It must needs be that
offences come; but,” He added, “<i>woe to that man</i> by
whom the offence cometh!” And shall we listen to
proposals to set aside the sentence of Divine Justice for
the tradition of men, and embody in human legislation
the teaching, “It must needs be that offences come; but
<i>peace</i> to that man by whom the offence cometh”? Let
us rather, answer every specious array of misleading
statistics, every false doctrine of medicine, every fresh cry
of alarm, every blasphemous utterance against Christ’s
sufficient power to redeem, every infidel attack upon the
sanctity of God’s holy law, with the inexorable “Thou
shalt not” of God’s eternal commandment.</p>

by the Military and Medical authorities in every command.</p>

<p class="extraMargin7">The treatment of venereal disease generally is a matter calling for special
devotion on the part of the medical profession.</p>

<p class="extraMargin7">To mitigate the evil now experienced, it is not only necessary to deal with
the cases of troops in hospitals, but to arrange for a wider-spread effort
which may reach the large centres of population, and, in this view, His
Excellency has suggested to the Government of India the desirability of
establishing a Medical School from which native practitioners trained in
the treatment of venereal disease may be sent to the various towns throughout
the country.</p>

<p class="extraMargin7">It can no longer be regarded as derogatory to the medical profession to
promote the careful treatment of men and women who are suffering from a
disease so injurious, and in mentioning the step which his Excellency has
taken, he desires me to indicate the extreme importance in the first instance
of medical officers being prepared to study and practice this particular
branch of their professional work, under the assurance that their doing so
must certainly result in the recognition of their efforts.</p>

<p class="extraMargin7">Whether or not the Lock Hospital system be extended, it is possible to
encourage in every Cantonment, and in Sudder and Regimental Bazars, the
treatment of those amongst the population who are suffering from venereal
disease. The bulk of the women who practise the trade of prostitution are
willing to subject themselves to examination by Dhais or by Medical Officers,
if by their so doing they can be allowed to reside in regimental bazars.</p>

<p class="extraMargin7">Where Lock Hospitals are not kept up, it becomes necessary, under a
regimental system, to arrange for the effective inspection of prostitutes
attached to regimental bazars, whether in cantonments or on the line of
march.</p>

<p class="extraMargin7">The isolation of women found diseased, and their maintenance while under
treatment, becomes also a question to be dealt with regimentally.</p>

<p class="extraMargin7">In the regimental bazars it is necessary to have a sufficient number of
women, to take care that they are sufficiently attractive, to provide them
with proper houses, and above all to insist upon means of ablution being
always available.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p class="extraMargin7">If young soldiers are carefully advised in regard to the advantage of
ablution and recognise that convenient arrangements exist in the regimental
bazar, they may be expected to avoid the risks involved in association with
women who are not recognised by the regimental authorities.</p>

<p class="extraMargin7">The employment of Dhais, and insistance upon the performance of the
acknowledged duties, is of great importance.</p>

<p class="extraMargin7">The removal of women who are pronounced to be incurably diseased from
cantonment limits, should be dealt with as a police question in communication
with the civil authorities.</p>

<p class="extraMargin7">In regard to the soldiers themselves, there are means at the disposal of
Commanding Officers to enforce a more careful avoidance of contact with
women who are diseased, where venereal is largely prevalent, the increase
of the regimental police in controlling the movements of the men is
imperative.</p>

<p class="extraMargin7">Frequent medical inspections should be ordered, and every endeavour
should be made to make the men realize their own responsibility in
assisting their officers, by indicating the women from whom disease has
been acquired.</p>

<p class="extraMargin7">Much may be done to encourage a feeling amongst the men that it should
be a point of honour to save each other where possible from risk in this
matter.</p>

<p class="extraMargin7">The medical inspection of all detachments before leaving or entering a
cantonment should be enforced by General Officers.</p>

<p class="extraMargin7">In conclusion, His Excellency desires me to impress upon all concerned
the necessity for meeting the present difficulty by increased individual
effort.</p>

<p class="extraMargin7">However much legislation may be desired to check the spread of disease,
it is necessary to abandon a sense of false modesty in dealing with the
matter in question, and to recognise that, as in the case of all other diseases,
its open treatment, and the widespread knowledge of its disastrous
effects, are the surest means of effacing it in each locality.</p>

<p class="center noind">LETTER TO LORD GEORGE HAMILTON.</p>

<p class="p1">The following is the full text of the letter of retractation
which Lady Henry Somerset addressed to Lord
George Hamilton, January 27, as it appeared in the
London daily papers of February 8, <span class="no-break">1898:—</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1 alignRight"><span class="smcap">Eastnor Castle, Ledbury</span>, <i>Jan. 27, 1898</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Lord George Hamilton,</span>—Your lordship invited me
ten months ago to give you my view of the dispatch that has been
addressed to the Government of India on the health of the army,
and in a letter in which I did so I ventured to suggest some
methods, moral and disciplinary, which seemed to me the only
ones likely to succeed, because they had at least the merit of being
logical.</p>

<p>I was led to do so by two considerations: first, the dispatch in
question seemed to imply that the Government would give every
encouragement to every form of elevating agency, and so emphasize
the altered spirit in which the subject was approached, and that
such suggested supervision would only affect an incorrigible
minimum; and second, that the system I had in mind would be so
drastic and penal in its nature as to make State interference odious
and finally impossible. That was ten months ago; and in that
time nothing has been done of which the public has heard to
strengthen the forces that make for moral improvement.</p>

<p>What has been done, viz., the repeal of the Indian Acts of 1895,
which prohibited inspection, has been in a direction exactly opposite.
It seems to have been the object of the Government to
obtain the maximum of impunity, with the minimum of protest,
from those who desire to see the State shape its actions according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>to Christian views of ethics. I need not tell your lordship I am not
writing to say how strongly I am still opposed to the course which
the Government has taken; but I find that my letter to your
lordship of last year has been taken by many to mean that I am on
the side of the accepted view of State regulation, and I am from
time to time quoted as a sympathizer with such views. I am
therefore writing to withdraw any proposals made in that letter for
this reason—that the events of the past year have convinced me of
the inadvisability and extreme danger of the system that in April
last I thought might be instituted.</p>

<p>The absence of any serious effort by the Government to bring
about a higher standard in the army is a final proof to me that, as
long as regulation of any kind can be resorted to as a remedy, it
will always be regarded as the one and only panacea. My view
was that it would be instituted as an odious but possibly effective
auxiliary to moral efforts. I find it will always be accepted as a
convenient substitute. I take the liberty of addressing this explicit
withdrawal of an endorsement in whatever form of the
principle of regulation; because it was in a letter to your lordship
that I originally incurred the responsibility. I trust, therefore, to
your lordship’s indulgence to forgive me for troubling you further
in the matter.—I remain, my lord, yours very truly,</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following comments on the above letter appeared
in <i>The Christian</i> (London), February 17, 1898:</p>


<p class="p1 center noind">REGULATION NO REMEDY.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1">In our last issue we inserted in full the letter of Lady Henry
Somerset, in which she withdrew from her unfortunate position
in relation to the State regulation of vice in India. We refrained,
for the time being, from comment, that her retractation might speak
for itself. We feel, therefore, the more free to remark upon it
now.</p>

<p>We rejoice, in the first place, that it has come at all, for it justifies
the principles for which we and other repealers have contended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>all these years. Lady Henry is convinced of “the inadvisability
and extreme danger” of her former proposals, and recognises now
that “as long as regulation of any kind can be resorted to as a
remedy, it will be regarded as the one and only panacea … [and]
will always be accepted as a convenient substitute [for moral
reform].”</p>

<p>It is therefore with thankfulness that we note her ladyship’s
“explicit withdrawal of an endorsement in whatever form of the
principle of regulation.”</p>

<p>This is all good so far as it goes, but it does not go far enough;
and, alas! it comes too late, for it can never undo the fearful
harm her action last year was the means of doing.</p>

<p>A public retractation is a hard and painful process, and we
sympathize with Lady Henry in the mental strain which it must
have cost her. But she has not been the only sufferer. It
were no small thing to cause division and discord in so gigantic
an organization as that over which she presided, so that at the
present time the movement is crippled and its machinery out of
gear. This might well have elicited an expression of regret,
which we hope may yet be forthcoming in some communication
to the Association she has so grievously wronged.</p>

<p>But more than this. Encouraged by her act, the Government
claimed the women of England as its supporters, defied moral
sentiment, and, on the crest of the wave of this unhappy dissension,
carried the re-enactment of the infamous C.&nbsp;D. Acts
among our sisters in India. It will take long and weary years
of uphill work to undo the mischief that her ill-advised and
hasty action wrought. Meantime, how many Indian women will
have succumbed to a shameful life and gone down to a dishonoured
grave?</p>

<p>The weakest point of Lady Henry’s letter is the erroneous
assumption on which it is based: that her proposals themselves
were moral, and that if the Government had instituted reforms
they might have successfully co-existed with regulation. But
how can regulation under any circumstances be a remedy? The
very terms are self-contradictory. What is morally wrong can
never be experimentally right, and this proposition neither casuistry
nor expediency can set aside. The only remedy is obedience to
the law of God; and if material aids be needed, let them be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>found in some active measures for the mental, moral, and spiritual
improvement of our soldiers in their leisure hours. This
is where reform is needed.</p>

</blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The foregoing Letter, together with the article from
<i>The Christian</i>, were printed in full in <i>The Shield</i> (the
official organ of the British Committee of the Federation
for the Abolition of the State Regulation of Vice) of
March, 1898, with the following</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center noind">NOTE BY THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>“We are glad to see that Lady Henry Somerset has now withdrawn
from the proposals for the Regulation of Vice with which
her name has become connected. At the same time we regret that
she still appears to think that her scheme could possibly have done
good if side by side with it had been some moralizing agency.
Our position is and has uniformly been that Regulation is essentially
under all circumstances a demoralizing agency, and must be
so from the very nature of the case; and that the provision of
women certified fit for immoral purposes is necessarily disastrous
whatever be the concomitants of such a proposition.”</p>
